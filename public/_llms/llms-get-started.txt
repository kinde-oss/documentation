At Kinde we want to empower founders to build their product their way, and integrate with us in a way that suits them. That’s why we’re building out the Kinde Management API and allowing Kinde users to register their API with us as well. ## Access the Kinde Management API You can only access Kinde's API via machine to machine (M2M) applications. Once connected, you can use our API to integrate Kinde functionality in your app without the admin interface layer. [Check out the API docs](/kinde-apis/management/). ## Integrate by registering your own API If your product has its own APIs, you can register them with Kinde to ensure access requests to your endpoints are secure and authorized. See [Register an API](/developer-tools/your-apis/register-manage-apis/).

# Get started - Connect - Set callback and redirect URLs

> Guide to setting up callback and redirect URLs for Kinde authentication including troubleshooting, wildcard usage, and security considerations.

get-started, connect

For authentication to work, you need to add callback URLs into your app. - An **Allowed callback URL** (also known as a redirect URI) is the web address where a user is sent after they authenticate. - An **Allowed logout redirect URL** is where the user is redirected when they sign out - sometimes these are the same as the allowed callback URLs. ## Set callback URLs 1. In Kinde, go to **Settings** > **Applications**. 2. View the details of an application. 3. In the **Allowed callback URLs** section, enter a callback URL. For example `https://[YOUR_SERVER_URL]/kinde_callback`. Make sure the callback URL does not have a trailing space. 4. In the **Allowed logout redirect URLs** field, enter a redirect URL. For example, enter your website address or the URL for a custom logout screen. Make sure you also register the redirect URL in your application settings. ## Troubleshoot ‘Invalid callback URL’ A common error reported by new users is that they receive an ‘invalid callback URL’ message when testing their connection. If you get this error, check the following: - Make sure there are no spaces before or after the callback URL in your Kinde application. - Ensure the callback URL in your code exactly matches the callback URL in your Kinde application. - The Client ID in your code must exactly match the Client ID in your Kinde application. - If you’re testing with a cloud hosting solution, such as Vercel, redeploy your application each time you update the environment variables. ## Wildcards in callback URLs You can use wildcards in the Kinde callback URLs. This is helpful if you have multiple subdomains, for example. Just replace the subdomain with an asterisk `*` — for example `https://*.mybusiness.com/callback`. <Aside type="warning"> We recommend using wildcards only for non-production purposes, as they present increased security risk. </Aside> ### Wildcard limitations - Root level domains are **not** allowed (`*.com` is not allowed). - Only a single wildcard is allowed per callback (`https://*.*.hello.com` is not allowed). - Wildcards are only allowed with `http` or `https` URL protocols (`*.hello.com`, `service:jmx:rmi://[host[:port]][urlPath]` are **not** allowed). - Wildcard has to be in the leftmost subdomain (`https://*.hello.com` is allowed, `https://hello.*.com` is **not** allowed). - Wildcards with prefixes and suffixes are allowed (`https://prefix-*-suffix.hello.com`) - A URL with a valid wildcard **will not** match a URL with more than one subdomain level in place of the wildcard. (`https://*.hello.com` will **not** work with `https://sub1.sub2.hello.com`) - Certain well-known shared hosting domains require a suffix or prefix for the wildcard (`*.vercel.app` is **not** allowed as this opens up anyone to authenticate on the Vercel platform, but `*something.vercel.app` is allowed as this will lock callbacks to your team or personal account). - Wildcards are not supported as part of a URL path (`https://sub1.sub2.hello.com/*` is not allowed). You can use the post-login redirect (available in several SDKs) to achieve dynamic navigation after authentication. ## Alternative methods of securing dynamic callbacks A more secure way of managing dynamic wildcards is to integrate with the Kinde Management API and manage them via API calls. This way you can be sure only allowed callbacks are authenticating against your Kinde instance. If your application lives in a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository connected to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), refer to [this section](/developer-tools/sdks/backend/nextjs-sdk/#working-with-preview-urls) on how to add wildcard callback URLs via the Kinde API. You can also use our [callbacks endpoint](/kinde-apis/management#tag/callbacks) in our Management API to add specific callbacks at the relevant point in your deployment. ## Distinguishing callback activity as sign in or sign up Kinde does not currently provide the ability to distinguish between a sign in and new registration, when the user lands on the callback URL. We recommend that you map the Kinde user IDs to your internal users. Then when the token from Kinde gets verified, - if the user doesn't exist: continues with **sign up** flow - if the user does exist: continues with **sign in** flow We don't include this information in the token because it's possible to create a user via an API, or in the admin UI (via custom import).

# Get started - Connect - Customize email sender

> Guide to customizing email sender configuration in Kinde including SMTP setup, email provider integration, and troubleshooting common issues.

get-started, connect

You can configure Kinde to send emails from your own preferred email provider. This means your users will receive communications from your business’s email address, and not Kinde’s. There are also other benefits, such as better control of email deliverability, analytics and tracking, scalability, email compliance, etc. ## Emails that will be sent from you When you set your own email provider details, the following emails will be sent from your preferred email address: - Sign up and sign in emails - One-time passcode (OTP) emails - Password reset codes Emails will come from `no-reply@kinde.com` if you choose not to set this up. ## Emails sent from Kinde Even if you enter custom sender details, these emails will still be sent from Kinde. - Invitation to join business team - triggered by manual or API addition of team member - Warnings and notifications of data export ## Requirements and recommendations - You can only have one email sender set up in Kinde - You need to set up provider details before making your environment live - The provider must support user/password sign in and TLS - Check the limitations of your provider (e.g. Microsoft O365 has daily send limits). We recommend using bulk email service providers such as SendGrid, Mailgun, Mailchimp, Postmark, etc. ## Add email sender SMTP details <Aside> Users who are in the process of signing in to your application when you enable this setting will not receive emails from the new address until they start a new authenticated session. </Aside> If you are setting this up and your production environment is already live, we recommend testing this in a staging or test environment first. 1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Email**. 2. Enter a **Sender name**. This is usually your business name, but might be a specific person. 3. Enable the **Use custom sender** switch. The SMTP details section opens. <img src="https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/d4c4b57d-9f1a-4b1c-638c-0a770c4fe400/public" alt="" width="672px" height="auto" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" decoding="async" /> 4. Enter the **Sender email**. This is the address your users will receive emails from. 5. Enter the SMTP details of your email provider: - Server name - this will be something like `yourbusiness.smtp.providername.com` - Port - use the one recommended by your email provider - Sign-in details - Username and password 6. Select **Send test email**. This sends a test email to the email address you are logged into Kinde with. 7. If the test is successful, select **Save**. 8. If the test is not successful, check the SMTP details (step 5) and try sending a test email again. If this does not work, see the troubleshooting section below. ## Edit email sender We recommend testing any changes to SMTP details in a non-production environment first. 1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Email**. 2. Change any of the details that you want. 3. Select **Send test email**. This sends a test email to the email address you are logged into Kinde with. 4. If the test is successful, select **Save**. ## Reset email sender You should only do this if your environment is not live. 1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Email**. 2. Disable the **Use custom sender** switch. This reverts back to use the default Kinde email address and removes SMTP details. 3. Select **Save**. ## Troubleshoot the SMTP provider connection Sometimes things go wrong with server connections and external provider configuration. There’s only so much we can assist with on our side, but if you get an SMTP error, check your provider documentation. Here’s a [list of errors](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2821#section-4.2.3) you might see (from the IETF), and here’s link to SMTP docs from some common providers. - [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/en-us/blog/smtp-server-response-codes-explained) - [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/developer/transactional/docs/smtp-integration/) - [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/support/article/1114-what-are-smtp-codes-and-how-can-i-troubleshoot-them) - [MailerSend](https://www.mailersend.com/blog/smtp-codes) - [Mailgun](https://documentation.mailgun.com/docs/mailgun/user-manual/sending-messages)

# Get started - Connect - Get application keys

get-started, connect

Application keys - or app keys - are credentials that you need to connect your project to Kinde. There are unique app keys for each application you have. This includes each machine to machine, front-end, back-end, or single-page application, etc. For more information about Kinde apps, see [Applications in Kinde](/build/applications/about-applications/). ## About app keys In the App keys section of your application in Kinde, you’ll find these details: - **Custom domain** - if you have opted to use one - **Domain** - this is the domain issued by Kinde - **Client ID** - unique for this app - **Client secret** - unique for this app (only back-end and M2M apps have client secrets) <Aside title="Rotating client secrets in Kinde"> You can only rotate client secrets for M2M applications. For backend applications, follow [these token security principles](/build/tokens/refresh-tokens/#token-security-recommendations). </Aside> ## View and copy app keys 1. Go to **Settings > Environment > Applications**. 2. Find the application you want to connect. 3. On the application tile, select **View details**. 4. Scroll to the **App keys** section. 5. Select **Copy** to copy the keys. 6. Make sure you securely store and manage your client secret as it provides access to your Kinde account for your product. <Aside> Note that front-end (client-side) applications do not have a client secret because they run in insecure environments, typically a browser. </Aside> 7. Add the app key details to the .env file in your code base or starter kit. Follow the instructions in the relevant [SDK](/developer-tools/about/our-sdks/) or the README file in the starter kit. 8. Do this for each application you want to connect.

Once you’ve got a [Kinde business and domain](https://app.kinde.com/register), you’re ready to get started. You’ve got a couple of options: - **Fast and easy** - Access the guided **Quick start** via the application tile on the Kinde home page, and follow the in-app instructions for using your own codebase. - **DIY** - Follow the instructions below. ## 1: Get your SDK Browse [our SDK documentation](/developer-tools/about/our-sdks/) for the one you want. SDK documentation contains language-specific instructions for connecting to Kinde. The steps in this document provide an overview of what you need to do. If we don’t have the language or framework you’re looking for, and you’re an experienced developer, try [using Kinde without an SDK](/developer-tools/about/using-kinde-without-an-sdk/). You can also [request an SDK](https://kinde-21631392.hs-sites.com/en-au/feature-request). ## 2: Add your application in Kinde Next, you’ll want to connect your code base to the application you set up in Kinde. Follow these steps to [add a new application to Kinde](/build/applications/add-and-manage-applications/). Kinde also comes with a couple of pre-built applications and you can use those ones if they suit. Sign in to Kinde and go to **Settings > Applications**. <img src="https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/98b14309-1d1d-406d-e9c0-c57003f24c00/public" alt="" width="672px" height="auto" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" decoding="async" /> ## 3: Get app keys View details of your application in Kinde and scroll down to [copy the App keys](/get-started/connect/getting-app-keys/). You’ll need to add these to your project’s `.env` file. <img src="https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/708e61e2-0738-4c51-e376-b675fac52300/public" alt="" width="672px" height="auto" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" decoding="async" /> ## 4: Add callback URLs to your Kinde application While you are viewing the application details, set the callback and redirect URLs for your app. These define where a user goes when they sign in to you app. You need to set these in order to enable users to sign up. Enter default localhost details, such as below. Note that `http://localhost:3000` is an example of a commonly used local development URL. It should be replaced with the URL where your app is running. <img src="https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/39a075f3-ab58-448b-037e-ed154c4a1300/public" alt="" width="672px" height="auto" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" decoding="async" /> You can add other URLs later, when your production environment is ready to go live or you set up a custom domain. ## 5: Add app keys to the .env file Your code base will include an .env file (or something similar) for storing configuration information. Add the Kinde app details you copied at step 3 to your .env file Here’s an example from the Next.js app router SDK. You replace `<your_kinde_client_id>`, `<your_kinde_client_secret>`, and `<your_kinde_subdomain>` with the Kinde app details. ```bash KINDE_CLIENT_ID=<your_kinde_client_id> KINDE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_kinde_client_secret> KINDE_ISSUER_URL=https://<your_kinde_subdomain>.kinde.com KINDE_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000 KINDE_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000 KINDE_POST_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000/dashboard ``` ## 6: Test user registration After you complete the previous steps, you should be able to register your first user. Register your first user by signing up yourself. To view the user, go to the main **Users** page in Kinde. Continue through the SDK to complete other configuration tasks. Then follow the link in step 7 below for a list of other set up tasks. ## 7: Set up Kinde to work how you want it Start configuring Kinde to work the way you want by exploring [common set up tasks](/get-started/guides/set-up-tasks/) and customizations. That’s when you’ll really start to build your business on Kinde.

# Get started - Guides - Common errors and codes

> Comprehensive troubleshooting guide for common Kinde error codes including authentication, SAML, OAuth, and verification issues.

get-started, guides

Depending on the complexity of your authentication setup, you or your users may occasionally encounter errors. Here are some common error codes and troubleshooting steps. ## Sorry we don't see way to authenticate you This error message typically appears when there's an issue with your authentication configuration or token handling. A few common causes include: - Expired or invalid tokens - Misconfigured authentication settings - Session management issues - Incorrect callback URLs ## State not found The `State not found` error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between your environment variables and the domain you're using during authentication. There may be a trailing space or incorrect syntax. ## Verification code not received (email) Verification codes are sent almost immediately when triggered. If a code is not received, it might be because: - Junk/spam folders​ - Email providers and devices may treat OTPs from unknown providers like Kinde as spam. Check your own spam folder, or ask your IT team if emails from Kinde are quarantined by firewalls or other IT defence systems. - Gmail delays​ - Google Workspace addresses can experience ~4 minute delays due to pre-delivery scanning - Microsoft Defender filters​ - Aggressive anti-spam filters sometimes quarantine verification emails for Outlook/Hotmail users If none of the above help troubleshoot the issue, contact Kinde support. ## Verification code not received (mobile device) Verification codes are sent almost immediately when triggered. If a code is not received, it might be because: - Network connectivity problems or poor signal strength - Carrier-level spam filtering blocking OTP messages - SMS delivery delays during peak usage times - Full storage preventing new messages from being received - Phone numbers in certain countries do sometimes experience issues. Contact us if you think this might be the case. We recommend using [Twilio](/authenticate/authentication-methods/phone-authentication/), a third-party SMS provider instead of Kinde's default service. This makes troubleshooting issues and accessing logs much easier. ## Error code 578 Description - Error coming back to Kinde while validating SAML response Troubleshooting - Check that the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL is correct on the identity provider ## Error code 780 Description - The OAuth 2.0 response failed - The token is valid, but the redirect is null ## Error code 928 Description - Error getting or reading the connected app configuration ## Error code 1004 Description - Error getting custom SAML config while initializing SAML redirect ## Error code 1656 Description - Error with authorization response - The request is missing a required parameter, includes an invalid parameter value, includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed Troubleshooting - Missing nonce on implicit flow - Redirect URI might not be with an https - Only a localhost suffix can be used with http - Error with workflow ## Error code 1829 Description - Error exchanging token on connected app callback Troubleshooting - Check the redirect URLs for a mismatch - Check the client credentials ## Error code 1959 Description - Error decoding SAML response - Response contains invalid characters for Base64 response ## Error code 3005 Description - Cannot handle SAML callback - The userProfile contains invalid values ## Error code 3420 Description - OAuth 2.0 response failed because token is invalid and redirect ID is null ## Error code 4179 Description - Handle Social OAuth 2.0 callback - error exchanging token - Expired secrets for social provider Troubleshooting - Check the secret being used with your social provider and ensure that it hasn't expired ## Error code 4617 Description - Error reading config on OAuth 2.0 callback Troubleshooting - Check that the client credentials in both Kinde and IDP are correct - Check that the redirect and callback URLs in both Kinde and IDP are correct ## Error code 5716 Description - OAuth 2.0 response failed due to an invalid token - Redirection was successful ## Error code 6722 Description - Error configuring SAML provider This error also appears if a user tries to sign in to your app via their identity provider setup (IdP-initiated) and not the sign in via the enterprise connection in your app, which is supported by Kinde as service provider (SP-initiated). Troubleshooting - Check that the settings in the Kinde enterprise connection are correct - Check enterprise connection metadata URL, entity ID, certificate ## Error code 7558 Description - SAML callback tokenInfo returned invalid data ## Error code 8030 Description - Error configuring SAML provider on redirect Troubleshooting - Check the enterprise connection metadata URL - Check that the IDP has the correct ACS URL ## Error code 8809 Description: - Received browser trust token is different from the one stored in the login session Troubleshooting - Start the auth flow again from the sign in or log in button - The user is trying to start a session in a new tab, browser, or device when there's already a partially completed session in progress - The user may have bookmarked the auth page when it's partially completed, instead of bookmarking the initial sign in or log in page ## Error code 9055 Description - Error getting custom SAML provider configuration - RelayState is invalid or doesn't exist Troubleshooting - Check the SAML callback URL - Check the entity ID - Check that the SAML IDP is returning a valid RelayState ## Error code 9364 Description - Error getting authentication request while initializing SAML redirect Troubleshooting - Check the enterprise connection private key, certificate, and signature method ## Error code 9697 Description - Disposable email detected while authenticating a user on sign up in a workflow ## Error code 9881 Description - Error storing tokens with connected app Troubleshooting - Check the refresh token is valid

Once you’ve got a [Kinde business and domain](https://app.kinde.com/register), you’re ready to get started. You’ve got a couple of options: - **Fast and easy** - Access the guided **Quick start** via the application tile on the Kinde home page, and follow the in-app instructions for using a starter kit. - **DIY** - Follow the instructions below. ## 1: Get a starter kit If you’re starting a brand new project or you just want to have a play around, using one of our starter kits gives you a ready-to-use project with Kinde already integrated with your tech of choice. [Grab a starter kit from GitHub](https://github.com/kinde-starter-kits) Open the README file in the starter kit for instructions on how to use it to connect to Kinde. Or follow the steps below. ## 2: Add an application in Kinde Kinde works by linking the application you set up in Kinde, with the app you’re creating yourself - or in this case, it will probably be an app that comes with the starter kit you chose. If you know what type of application you’re building, [add it to Kinde](/build/applications/add-and-manage-applications/). Kinde also comes with a couple of pre-built applications and you can use those ones if they suit. Go to **Settings > Applications**. <img src="https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/98b14309-1d1d-406d-e9c0-c57003f24c00/public" alt="" width="672px" height="auto" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" decoding="async" /> ## 3: Get app keys View details of the application in Kinde and scroll down to [copy the App keys](/get-started/connect/getting-app-keys/). You’ll need to add these to the .env file that came with the starter kit. <img src="https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/708e61e2-0738-4c51-e376-b675fac52300/public" alt="" width="672px" height="auto" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" decoding="async" /> ## 4: Add app keys to the .env file Your starter kit came with a file called `.env-sample` (or something close to that). You will want to rename it `.env`. The .env file contains configuration information for linking with Kinde. Follow the README instructions in your starter kit to add your app keys to the .env file. Here’s an example from the Next.js app router starter kit. You replace `<your_kinde_client_id>`, `<your_kinde_client_secret>`, and `<your_kinde_subdomain>` with details from Kinde. ```bash KINDE_CLIENT_ID=<your_kinde_client_id> KINDE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_kinde_client_secret> KINDE_ISSUER_URL=https://<your_kinde_subdomain>.kinde.com KINDE_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000 KINDE_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000 KINDE_POST_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000/dashboard ``` ## 5: Add callback URLs to your Kinde app Callback and redirect URLs define where a user goes when they sign in to you app. You need to set these in order to enable users to sign up. Go to **Settings > Applications** and select **View details** on your application in Kinde. Enter the URL details as per your starter pack README file. For now, it will be a localhost URL. But you can add other URLs later, when your production environment is live or you set up a custom domain. <img src="https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/39a075f3-ab58-448b-037e-ed154c4a1300/public" alt="" width="672px" height="auto" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" decoding="async" /> ## 6: Test user registration After you complete the previous steps, you should be able to register your first user. 1. Open a terminal window where your project is running. 2. View the README file in your starter kit to get the command to start your local server and view your project in a browser. For example, the command for Next.js is `npm run dev`. 3. Once your project is running in the browser, select **Sign up** to register your first user. 4. When you’re done, view the user in the main **Users** page in Kinde. Now you’re ready to take on the rest of the Kinde set up tasks. ## 7: Set up Kinde to work how you want it Start configuring Kinde to work the way you want by exploring [common set up tasks](/get-started/guides/set-up-tasks/) and customizations. That’s when you’ll really start to build your business on Kinde.

# Get started - Learn about kinde - Kinde product security information

> Comprehensive overview of Kinde's security practices including XSS protection, CSRF prevention, bot detection, password standards, and TLS enforcement.

get-started, learn-about-kinde

Here’s some of the practices, standards, and methods we use to keep your data, and user’s data secure. ## Auth pages require known origins in the callback URL To help prevent [XSS attacks](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html), all authentication pages require a [callback URL](/get-started/connect/callback-urls/) to be set in Kinde. Authentication does not work correctly without them. Our application will check the callback URLs and parse out the domain for an origin check. ## Bot detection Native bot detection is on the roadmap, which will allow customers to bring their own Cloudflare integration key to apply bot detection and protections directly to their Kinde hosted auth pages. This will allow customers to adjust the level of protection based on their own risk profile. Please see our [roadmap](https://updates.kinde.com/board) for updates. To protect against bot driven volumetric attacks, we use AWS WAF to block traffic that matches OWASP threat rules, known malicious IP addresses, and AWS managed rules. Alternatively, customers can implement bot detection and CAPTCHA if your DNS is hosted via Cloudflare. Kinde's hosted pages, with a custom domain, can be proxied through Cloudflare to incorporate their advanced web attack protection features, including bot detection and Cloudflare's Turnstile (Cloudflare's equivalent to CAPTCHA). Please see [Proxy your Kinde auth pages through Cloudflare](/authenticate/custom-configurations/proxy-your-kinde-auth-pages-through-cloudflare/) for more information. ## Credential stuffing protection Kinde protects from credential stuffing attacks with a combination of techniques. To protect against volumetric attacks, we use AWS WAF to block traffic that matches OWASP threat rules and also use our own application throttling. To protect against password brute forcing, we will automatically lock out accounts after 5 consecutive failed attempts of the password or passwordless code (OTP, password, or multi-factor authentication) for a short period of time. Admins can manually unlock accounts if necessary. Bot detection (see previous section) can be used to provide additional protection. ## CSRF protections via `state` parameter Kinde protects against [CSRF](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html) attacks by using and recommending the `state` parameter as part of an auth token. All state changing requests generate a CSRF tokens server side, which are validated on the backed, and cookies are set to sameSite `strict`. ## Hosted auth pages prevent clickjacking To prevent [clickjacking](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Clickjacking_Defense_Cheat_Sheet.html) attacks where a user’s personal information or credentials may be stolen by hidden iFrames, use Kinde’s hosted pages for authentication. Hosted pages have protections in place such as such as strict CSP and security headers to prevent itself from being embedded as an iFrame. Kinde controls and hosts the authentication pages, so the risk for protecting pages is assumed by Kinde rather than you. ## Enforced password standards Kinde provides a baseline password protection policy for any customer who wants to include password authentication in their product. - 8 character minimum - No complexity requirements - Blocking of 1,000,000 most common passwords - 5 incorrect attempts locks account out for 5 minutes Note that Kinde recommends, where possible, not using passwords for authentication and instead using [passwordless](/authenticate/about-auth/authentication-methods/#passwordless) or [social](/authenticate/social-sign-in/add-social-sign-in/) integrations. If using passwords for authentication, we recommend adding [multi-factor authentication](/authenticate/multi-factor-auth/about-multi-factor-authentication/) as an option for users. ## Password security If your business is set up so users sign in with passwords, you can be assured that Kinde uses a hashing algorithm and never stores passwords as text. Specifically, we use bcrypt for hashing of passwords in our database. ## Denial of service mitigation via rate limits and throttles Kinde has implemented an application level rate limit and throttle. This helps protect our shared infrastructure and our customers from excessive network traffic that could lead to an outage. Our rate limits are tuned based on the type of traffic, such as API, admin pages, or general auth usage, and will limit the number of connections from an IP in a short space of time. This generally covers all interactions for our service. ## Device fingerprinting prevents session hijacking Kinde implements a method of device fingerprinting during the authentication flow to block the transfer of sessions between different browsers or devices that could lead to [session hijacking](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html). ## Enforcement of TLS version and ciphers Kinde enforces strict [TLS versions](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Transport_Layer_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html) and ciphers across it’s public facing websites and API endpoints. TLS 1.3 - TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 - TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 - TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 TLS 1.2 - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384 ## Preventing third-party script injections with XSS and CSP Kinde uses various techniques to help prevent the execution of unknown third party scripts and the injection of malicious third party scripts by using XSS protection and CSP. Kinde’s server rendered application encodes output by default, which prevents most opportunities to inject HTML. The Content Security Policy configured across our webpages prevents the execution of inline and third party scripts. ## Blocking malicious traffic with our WAF Kinde has implemented a web application firewall ([WAF](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Secure_Cloud_Architecture_Cheat_Sheet.html#web-application-firewall)) across all of our public-facing websites and API endpoints. We use AWS WAF to block traffic that matches OWASP threat rules, known malicious IP addresses, and AWS managed rules.

# Get started - Switch to kinde - Migrate to Kinde from Auth0

> Comprehensive guide to migrating from Auth0 to Kinde including user data export, password migration, social identities, and organizational setup.

auth0 migration, user import, password migration, oauth2, oidc, social identities, organizations, roles, permissions
get-started, switch-to-kinde

This guide is designed to help you migrate from Auth0 to Kinde. Switching between providers for any service can be daunting, and especially where user data is involved. We’ll walk you through the process or migrating, to take some of the pain away. If you’ve got a lot of users (your export file is over 20MB) or are concerned about file size limits, you can contact us to ensure the import goes smoothly. ## Still not sure about moving to Kinde? If you want to compare Kinde with Auth0, [this page](https://kinde.com/comparisons/auth0-alternative/) has some useful information. A key point to note is that Kinde is OAuth2/OIDC compatible, issuing similar tokens to Auth0. You only need to update the token claims when you migrate. ## Step 1: Prepare your Kinde business for migration If you haven’t already got a Kinde account, [register for free here](https://app.kinde.com/register) (no credit card required). - Set up the [authentication methods](/authenticate/about-auth/about-authentication/) in Kinde. You can replicate the auth methods you currently use with Auth0, or [set up new methods for users](/authenticate/authentication-methods/set-up-user-authentication/), e.g. passwordless. - If your users sign in with passwords, be sure to enable [password authentication](/authenticate/authentication-methods/password-authentication/). - [Create organizations in Kinde](/build/organizations/add-and-manage-organizations/) - only if you use this function to support multi-tenancy (for example, in a B2B structure) or if you manage separate user groups this way. - Add [roles](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/user-roles/) and [permissions](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/user-permissions/) in Kinde, if you intend to import these details with users. - Review the [Migrating other objects](/get-started/switch-to-kinde/auth0-to-kinde/#other-objects-you-may-want-to-bring-from-auth0) topic below. ## Step 2: Get the Auth0 extension to export users Auth0 doesn’t have an export option by default, so you’ll need to install an export extension. 1. Go to [Auth0 Dashboard > Extensions](https://manage.auth0.com/#/extensions), and select **User Import / Export**. 2. When prompted, select **Install**. ![Auth0 extension screen shot](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/2a8f1e39-2050-4c14-146a-338ecb57bb00/public) You'll now see it in your list of installed extensions. The first time you launch it, you'll be asked to grant permission for the extension to access your Auth0 account. ## Step 3: Export user data from Auth0 File format guidelines: - User details and passwords must be in NDJSON (Newline Delimited JSON) format - Import file size limit is 20MB. You may need to split the file if the exported size exceeds this. ### Supported auth methods Kinde supports migrating the following authentication methods from Auth0: Usernames, Email, Phone, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, GitHub, Twitch, Bitbucket. If you need to migrate another authentication type from Auth0 please get in touch with support. Auth methods are shown in the `connection` attribute. These are represented as follows in the identity array: - Username-Password-Authentication - email - sms - google-oauth2 - github - twitch - facebook - bitbucket - windowslive ### Can’t get the passwords from Auth0? Some Auth0 plans don’t allow password exports, or you might not want to wait 2 weeks for the file. If this is the case, import the user data you’re able to, and Kinde will ask users to set a new password the next time they sign in. ### Export Auth0 data 1. Launch the extension by selecting **Import / Export Extension.** 2. Export your existing Auth0 users associated with database connections, select **Export**. ![Auth0 export selections screen shot](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/0748f464-d46f-4455-20dc-8f1c677fbb00/public) 3. Select **Add default fields** and add the **identities** field to the import list. **Identities** data distinguishes the type of identity, e.g. username, phone, GitHub, Google, etc. 4. Change the **Export Format** to **.json**. 5. When you're ready, click **Export [X] Users.** (**X** is the number of users you're exporting). 6. Once the export is complete, select **Download** to get the file containing your user’s information. This is the main file you’ll need to migrate your users; the other file is the password hashes. ## Step 4: Import user data into Kinde 1. In Kinde, go to **Users**, then select **Import users**. 2. Select **Auth0.** ![Import from Kinde tool screen shot](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/10090edb-3f26-405d-898d-2dfedd155100/public) 3. You’ll be presented with 2 options: 1. **Import users only** - import users first and passwords after. You can also use this method if you want to allow users to reset their password or sign in another way. 2. **Import passwords only** - only choose this if you have already imported users. 4. Follow the on-screen prompts to import the data. 5. If there are any [errors with the import](/manage-users/add-and-edit/troubleshoot-user-import-errors/), you will be able to view them afterwards. 6. Most import errors can be fixed by editing the json file and then re-importing into Kinde. Once the password hashes have been imported, your users will be able to sign in to Kinde with their existing password. ### How Auth0 user identities are treated on import Social identities without an email can be imported and are identified by the `connection` attribute. You can also import users with multiple identities; these will be listed under the user’s profile. ## After the migration ### **Communication to users after import** Kinde does not send any notifications or invitations to users when they are added to Kinde via import. The idea is that your users have a seamless experience that feels (almost) like it always has in your app. Similarly, if you add users via API, Kinde does not send an email or notification to the user. If you’ve made changes to their sign in experience — for example adding multi-factor authentication — then consider contacting your users to let them know their sign in experience will be changed. ### Additional consequences of migration Importing all your existing users and passwords following the above process should mean that your users won’t notice anything when they next sign in. This is the optimal experience. However: - If a user changes their password after the user export and while the migration is in progress, they will need to reset their password to sign in. - If you have set up a new authentication method as part of the user migration (for instance, going password-less) your users will be prompted to use the new method on sign in. - If you add or remove roles or permissions, users may gain/lose access to parts of your system. During and following the migration, we recommend checking for these issues. ### There is no check for weak passwords When you import passwords, Kinde does not check for password strength. You’ll want to enforce your own password policies for users. ### Other objects you may want to bring from Auth0 If you have important objects that need to be migrated, such as organizations or roles outside the basic user information, you can import them, or add them via the [Kinde management API](/kinde-apis/management/). Before you migrate, however, be aware that the functionality of these objects may differ between Auth0 and Kinde. Here’s some similarities and differences to note: - Auth0 has the concept of [Tenants](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/learn-the-basics) which group other objects such as users and applications together. Kinde calls these [Businesses](/build/set-up-options/run-multiple-businesses/) and is set up to allow you to run multiple businesses with a single Kinde account. - Both Kinde and Auth0 have [Organizations](/build/organizations/multi-tenancy-using-organizations/) to allow you to build multi-tenant applications. The main difference being that Kinde treats organizations as a first class citizen. - Each business Kinde allows you to have multiple [Environments](/build/environments/environments/) and these contain organizations, users and applications. - In Auth0, [Applications](https://auth0.com/docs/applications/set-up-an-application) are what your users can sign in to. They are also called [Applications](/build/applications/add-and-manage-applications/) in Kinde and work in essentially the same way. - In Auth0, [Identity Providers](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders) are a source of data for users. Kinde calls these connections or authentication providers. - In Auth0, [Roles and Permissions](https://auth0.com/docs/authorization/rbac/roles) provide information about what your users can do in your applications. Kinde also has [Roles](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/user-roles/) and [Permissions](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/user-permissions/) and they are assigned on a per user, per organization basis, meaning the same user can have different permissions in different organizations. For the Auth0 equivalent of user-level roles/permissions, use the [default organization](/build/organizations/orgs-for-developers/). - Kinde’s hosted sign-up pages are a very similar concept to [Auth0’s Universal Login](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login). ## Help is here We’ve tried to make onboarding to Kinde as easy as possible, because we know it’s a pain to break up with your old provider. We’re here to help and can assist with your migration.

# Get started - Switch to kinde - Migrate to Kinde for user authentication

> Comprehensive guide to migrating user authentication to Kinde including CSV import, password migration, authentication setup, and organizational configuration.

user migration, csv import, password migration, authentication methods, organizations, roles, permissions, hashing methods
get-started, switch-to-kinde

If you are currently using a different authentication tool to manage users, you can switch to Kinde pretty quickly. The method described here involves importing user details from CSV files into Kinde. [Follow this other guide](/get-started/switch-to-kinde/auth0-to-kinde/) if you are switching from Auth0. If you’ve got a lot of users (your export file is over 5MB) or are concerned about file size limits, you can contact us to ensure the import goes smoothly. ## Before you import users - [Create organizations in Kinde](/build/organizations/add-and-manage-organizations/) - only if you use this function to support multi-tenancy (for example, in a B2B structure) or if you manage separate user groups this way. - Add [roles](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/user-roles/) and [permissions](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/user-permissions/) in Kinde, if you intend to import these details with users. ### Set up user authentication We recommend setting up user authentication in Kinde before importing. For example, set up: - Passwords - switch this option on before importing user passwords - Passwordless - users will be sent a one-time code to sign in - Social sign-on - users can sign up and in using Google, Apple, etc. - Enterprise - SAML or Entra ID. **Note: Importing users from Azure** Set up the [MS Entra ID connection in Kinde](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/azure/) before you import your users. Then when you import, Kinde will match users to the relevant connection based on their email address. For more details, see [Authentication methods](/authenticate/authentication-methods/set-up-user-authentication/). ## Step 1: Prepare user data You can export user details and data fairly easily from most auth providers. However, some providers require you to separately request password details for users and this can take a little while. If you’re using your own auth system, prepare data as described below. ### File format User data can only be imported from a CSV file. Depending on what you currently use for auth, you will need to export or prepare data in a CSV file. Kinde can import files up to 5MB. You may need to split the import into batches if you have a lot of users. ### Export data from other systems or your own system When exporting data from another auth system or your own system, the CSV file you export may need to be edited to ensure data is formatted in rows with some of these column headings. ### Required **data** - `email` - minimum required information - `external_organization_id` - Only required if you are importing roles and permissions <Aside> The more data that you include for import, the easier we can set up your users in Kinde. Kinde will not duplicate users with existing email addresses. </Aside> ### **Other user data** - `first_name` and `last_name` - `id` (also referred to as `provided id`) - unique to the auth provider and helps us match records as they are imported. - `phone` - including the international code with no spaces and no leading ‘0’, for example. +61555111555. Required for phone authentication. ([beta feature](https://kinde-21631392.hs-sites.com/en-au/beta-feature-interest)) - `phone_verified` - phone number verification status: TRUE or FALSE ([beta feature](https://kinde-21631392.hs-sites.com/en-au/beta-feature-interest)) - `email` - the user’s email address - `email_verified` - email verification status: TRUE or FALSE - `role_key` - the role key for the role a user will be assigned on import. If the user is to be assigned more than one role, use a comma separated list. - `permission_key` - the permissions key for the permission a user will be assigned (that is not included in their role). If the user is to be assigned more than one permission, use a comma separated list. - `external_organization_id` - the ID of the organizations you want the user to be imported into (if applicable). Only required if you are importing roles and permissions with user data. If the user belongs to more than one organization, use a comma separated list. <Aside> Note that this is NOT the same as the **Organization code** in Kinde, which is a Kinde-supplied ID. </Aside> ### Password data (optional) - `hashed_password` - the user’s password encrypted using a hashing method or algorithm. - `hashing_method` - the name of the algorithm used to encrypt the user’s password. Currently **crypt**, **bcrypt**, **sha256**, **md5**, and **wordpress** are supported. [Contact us](https://kinde-21631392.hs-sites.com/en-au/feature-request) if you need a different method. - `salt` - extra characters added to passwords to make them stronger - `salt_position` - position of salt in password string. E.g. prefix (before) or suffix (after). - `salt_format` - format of the salt, e.g. hex, string, etc. <Aside title="bcrypt $2b variant support:"> Please note if you are importing bcrypt hashes with the $2b variant, Kinde will substitute this for the $2a variant. These are interchangeable as long as you were not running OpenBSD at the time the hashes were generated. </Aside> <Aside title="sha256 support:"> Provide the hash in hex format. Import the salt using the `salt` column. For the `salt_format`, specify how the salt should be interpreted: e.g. **hex** for a hex-encoded string (68656c6c6f for hello). By default, the salt is treated as a plain string, and escape sequences (like \n or \v) are treated as literal characters. </Aside> | Hashing method | Salt | Salt position | | -------------- | -------- | ------------------------- | | md5 | Optional | required if salt included | | bcrypt | | | | crypt | Optional | | | wordpress | Optional | | | sha256 | Optional | required if salt included | ### Example CSV ```text email,first_name,last_name,email_verified,hashed_password,hashing_method,external_organization_id bills@company.com,bill,smith,TRUE,#########,md5,abc001 carlosg@company.com,carlos,garcia,TRUE,#########,md5,abc001 lliu@company.com,lee,liu,FALSE,#########,md5,xyz002 ``` ### Check for errors Before importing, check the CSV for missing information or duplication. Kinde will check for some errors during import, and report these back to you. ### Passwords If you want your users to have an uninterrupted sign in experience as you change providers, you will need to bring their password data from your auth provider. Passwords are usually ‘hashed’ or encrypted so they cannot be read and they may be ‘salted’ as well (see above). If you decide not to import passwords, however, it’s not a big deal. Users will be prompted to reset their password or sign in using whatever authentication methods you have chosen to set up in Kinde. ## Step 2: Import users Once you have your user details, you’re ready to import them. 1. In Kinde, go to **Users**, then select **Import users**. 2. Select the **Import users** tab and then select **Import from a CSV** 3. Follow the on-screen prompts to upload the user data. 4. If there are any errors with the import, you will be able to view them afterwards. 5. Most import errors can be fixed by editing the CSV file and then re-importing into Kinde. Any records that have already been imported and have not been edited, will be ignored. For full instructions, see [Import or update users in bulk](/manage-users/add-and-edit/import-users-in-bulk/). ## After the migration ### **Communication to users after import** Kinde does not send any notifications or invitations to users when they are added to Kinde via import. The idea is that your users have a seamless experience that feels (almost) like it always has in your app. Similarly, if you add users via API, Kinde does not send an email or notification to the user. If you’ve made changes to their sign in experience — for example adding multi-factor authentication — then consider contacting your users to let them know their sign in experience will be changed. ### Additional consequences of migration Importing all your existing users and passwords following the above process should mean that your users won’t notice anything when they next sign in. This is the optimal experience. However: - If a user changes their password after the user export and while the migration is in progress, they will need to reset their password to sign in. - If you have set up a new authentication method as part of the user migration (for instance, going password-less) your users will be prompted to use the new method on sign in. - If you add or remove roles or permissions, users may gain/lose access to parts of your system. During and following the migration, we recommend checking for these issues. ### There is no check for weak passwords When you import passwords, Kinde does not check for password strength. You’ll want to enforce your own password policies for users.
