# Manage your account - Profile and plan - Changing your Kinde plan

> Comprehensive guide to changing Kinde plans including upgrade/downgrade processes, billing details, refund policies, and custom plan options.

plan change, plan upgrade, plan downgrade, subscription charges, metered usage, unit costs, stripe payment, custom invoicing, refunds, plan cancellation
manage-your-account, profile-and-plan

Kinde offers multiple plans, including a free plan. When you decide to upgrade to a higher plan, charges apply, including: - a base subscription price - metered usage charges (e.g. for MAU) - unit costs for expanding feature capacity (e.g. for adding more environments) - other recurring costs You can upgrade or downgrade plans at any time. ## How plan charges work When you buy a plan or upgrade, you will be immediately charged the base subscription price for the month ahead. On the following invoice (after the first monthly billing cycle), you will be charged for any metered and unit costs for the previous month, plus the monthly base subscription price for the next month. We currently accept credit cards as a means of payment, and use Stripe to process and secure transactions. Custom invoicing arrangements (e.g. by bank transfer, annual, currency) are available to enterprise customers. ## How to change your plan You’ll see multiple upgrade prompts throughout the Kinde interface, with a button for upgrading and choosing a plan. Click any of these prompts and you will be shown the plan selector and guided through the sign-up process. Or you can do the following: 1. On the Kinde home page, select the avatar menu at the bottom left, and then select **Business settings**. 2. In the window that opens, select **Plan**. 3. At the top of the window, select **Change plan**. The plan selector opens. 4. Select the plan you want to change to. - If you upgrade, you will be immediately charged the full subscription price. Upgrade features are available immediately. - If you downgrade, you can still use Kinde until the end of your billing period. Remember to [export your data](https://docs.kinde.com/manage-your-account/your-data/exporting-data/) You’ll be asked to confirm credit card details each time you upgrade, even if it’s from a paid plan to a paid plan. ## Refunds for downgrade If you downgrade, we can partially refund the monthly base subscription price for unused days. You will still need to pay for anything metered that you use. ## Cancelling your Kinde plan We don't have self-serve for cancelling plans, but you can downgrade to the free plan to avoid further charges, then also delete your business if you want. We want your experience at Kinde to be great, even if you decide to leave us. You can be assured that we will err on the side of crediting back any costs that you should not be charged for. To discuss any concerns, contact support@kinde.com and we will sort it out. ## Speak to an advisor about a custom plan We know some businesses are more complex than others. If you feel you have special requirements or would like to discuss how we can better support your business growth, contact us at support@kinde.com and we’ll make an appointment to chat.

# Manage your account - Your data - Check your MAU and MAO

> Guide to checking MAU and MAO metrics in Kinde including calculation methods, billing period tracking, and business growth indicators.

mau, monthly active users, mao, monthly active organizations, billing period, access tokens, b2b metrics, business growth, plan limits, subscription tracking
manage-your-account, your-data

The number of monthly active users (MAU) you have is a common metric for predicting recurring revenue and tracking business growth. If you have business customers, the number of monthly active organizations (MAO) is another important indicator of how your business is going. Higher MAU and MAO means more customers. ## **How MAU is calculated** Kinde counts one MAU for every user who is ‘active’ during a billing period. Active means they have been issued at least one access token. One MAU is counted regardless of how many times the same user signs in. If a user is created and then deleted before signing in, they are not counted in MAU. However, if a user signs in during a billing period and they are deleted within the same period, they are still counted in MAU. ## How MAO is calculated If you are a B2B company, your business customers will be managed in Kinde as an organization. For MAO calculations, Kinde considers an organization is 'active' if there are at least 2 users, and at least one of those users is active (i.e they sign in to the organization) during a billing period. If an organization is created and deleted in the same monthly billing period, it will only be counted as MAO if the above conditions are met. ## To check your MAU and MAO 1. On the Kinde home page, select the avatar menu at the bottom left and then select **Business Settings**. 2. Select *Plan** in the side menu. 2. In the main **Subscription** area of the window, view your MAU and MAO. If you’re on a free plan, you’ll be able to see when you’re approaching or exceeding free plan limits. If you’re on a paid plan, you’ll be able to see how costs are tracking in your current bill cycle. For full details of inclusions and pricing, see [Kinde plan details](https://kinde.com/pricing/).

# Manage your account - Your data - Delete your Kinde business

> Guide to deleting a Kinde business including irreversible consequences, data export requirements, and domain management considerations.

delete business, business deletion, nuclear action, data destruction, domain reuse, custom domain, data export, team access, paid plans, support contact
manage-your-account, your-data

Deleting a business in Kinde is a nuclear action that cannot be reversed. Only a business owner can delete the business. ## IMPORTANT: Read this document before you delete ### When you delete a business - The domain associated with the business can't be used again (unless freed up by Kinde) - All environments, applications, organizations, users, and stored data is destroyed - Owner, admin, and team member access to the business is removed - Any connections and integrations you set up will break Once you delete a business, the action cannot be reversed. <Aside type="warning"> Do not delete the business if you want to re-use the Kinde domain issued to the business. Instead, consider using a [custom domain](/build/domains/pointing-your-domain/). </Aside> ### Before you delete a business - Make sure you [export your data](/manage-your-account/your-data/exporting-data/) before you delete - Remove any custom domain you have set up - Let team members know they will no longer be able to access the business ## Delete your business <Aside type="warning"> Only owners of businesses on a free plan can self-serve delete. All businesses on paid plans need to contact Kinde support. </Aside> 1. Sign in to the business you want to delete. 2. Go to **Settings > Business > Details**. 3. Scroll to the the **Admin functions** section and select **Delete business**. 4. Confirm the action in the dialog by selecting **Delete business**. The business is deleted and can no longer be accessed. ## Other information Team members who have access to multiple businesses can still access those businesses. If you have other Kinde businesses, the data in those businesses will not be affected. If you want to re-use the domain of the business you delete, you need to contact support@kinde.com to make this possible.

# Manage your account - Your data - Export your data

> Comprehensive guide to exporting Kinde data including secure password export processes, encryption/decryption, and data format specifications.

data export, password export, owner approval, encryption, decryption, openssl, ndjson format, security process, data protection, export approval
manage-your-account, your-data

We know it’s really important that you can easily get your data out of Kinde when you need to. It’s equally important that your data - especially password data - is safe and cannot be easily accessed. **Important note**: For security reasons, only team members who are **Owners** can export data. You can download most of your Kinde data in a few steps, but if the export includes user passwords, this triggers an owner approval process to ensure that only authorized people can access them. See the fairly long but secure process outlined below. Big disclaimer of course: Once you have downloaded your data, you are entirely responsible for protecting it. ## Initiate a data export 1. Go to **Settings > Business > Details** to the **Business Information** page in Kinde. 2. In the **Export data** section, select **Export**. Note, this section is only visible if you are an **Owner**. 3. In the window that appears, select one of the export options. 4. If you select **All data (except passwords)**: 1. Select **Next**. You will be sent an email with a confirmation code. 2. Enter the code and select **Next**. The download file is generated. 3. Download the file. Note that this is the only opportunity to download. To get the file again, you need to go back to step 2. 5. If you select **All data**: 1. Select **Next**. A request is sent to all business owners to approve the export. 2. Read about the process below. ## The export and approval process (when passwords are included) There are a number of checks and validations done to enable password export. Unfortunately there is no way to avoid this being long and somewhat notification-heavy, as the aim is to prevent unauthorized access to passwords and other data. <Aside> If a business has a sole owner, this might seem like a more complex process than it needs to be. But we implemented this process to maximize security. At some stage in future we may optimize it for the solo owner experience, but for now, this applies to all businesses. </Aside> Here’s how it works: 1. An owner initiates a data export (including passwords) in Kinde. See above. 2. All Kinde owners are notified by email of the export request (including any additional owners). They then have 24 hours to review it and ensure that it is a legitimate request. Note that this email is still sent if there is only one owner. 3. If the request seems suspect, any owner can reject it immediately: 1. Select **Review** in the email to open the request in Kinde. 2. Select **Reject** in the far column of the data export table. This ends the export process. 4. If the request is fine to approve, the notified owners have to wait 24 hours from the initial request for a new email which will allow them to approve the request in Kinde. 5. The request can be approved by whichever notified owner responds first: 1. Select **View** in the email. 2. Select **Approve** in the right column of the data export table. 3. Enter a one-time code to verify your identity and complete the approval. 6. Approval triggers an email to the original requestor, who receives instructions on how to download the data. To download: 1. In the email, select **Download**. This opens Kinde. 2. Select the **Download** button in the export area. A confirmation window opens. 3. Enter the one-time verification code sent to your email and select **Next**. The data starts to be prepared. 4. After the data is generated, a window appears showing an encrypted .dat file for download, as well as a **Key** and an **Initialization Vector** for decrypting the file. 5. Copy the **Key** and the **Initialization Vector** somewhere you can access it again later. 6. Download the file. Note that this is the only opportunity to download. To get the file again, you need to request the data export again. 7. An email is sent to the owner, advising them you have downloaded the data. 8. Next, decrypt the downloaded file (see below). We know this is a long process, especially since you are likely both the requestor and the owner, but we have made password security a top priority. ## Decrypt your data export file To decrypt the .dat file, you need to run a decryption command. You can use a tool like OpenSSL or a native command prompt. 1. Open a command prompt window. 2. Paste the following command. `openssl aes-256-ctr -d -e -in /path/to/kinde_export.dat -out /path/to/kinde_export.zip -nosalt -p -K YOUR_ENCRYPTION_KEY -iv YOUR_ENCRYPTION_IV` 3. Replace `YOUR_ENCRYPTION_KEY` with the **Key** you copied above. 4. Replace `YOUR_ENCRYPTION_IV` with the **Initialization Vector** you copied above. 5. Replace the **-in** path with the .dat file location (e.g. `-in ~/Downloads/kinde_export.dat` ), and update the **-out** path to where you would like the decrypted zip file to be generated (e.g. `-out ~/Desktop/kinde_export.zip` ) Example of how the command might look: ```text openssl aes-256-ctr -d -e -in /Users/DriveName/Downloads/kinde_export.dat -out /Users/Drivename/Desktop/kinde_export.zip -nosalt -p -K 5f2xxxxxxx6b51ca282745852b0caxxxxxxxxxxxcd5832ecb97500956f3 -iv 4d4axxxxxxxxd2bd1994xxxxc698d3 ``` 6. Press **Enter**. The file decrypted kinde_export.zip file should appear in the specified -out location. ## Cancel a request At any time, the person who made the export request can cancel it by going to the **Business Information** page in Kinde and selecting **Cancel request**. This ends both the export and approval process. ## What the exported data looks like Data is exported in NDJSON format, with separate data files for users and organizations. Here’s an example of `users.ndjson`. ```json { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#", "type": "object", "properties": { "id": { "type": "string", "description": "Unique identifier for the object" }, "email": { "type": ["string", "null"], "format": "email", "description": "Email address of the user" }, "phone": { "type": ["string", "null"], "description": "Phone number of the user, if available" }, "username": { "type": ["string", "null"], "description": "Username of the user, if available" }, "last_name": { "type": ["string", "null"], "description": "Last name of the user, if available" }, "created_on": { "type": "string", "format": "date-time", "description": "Timestamp when the user was created" }, "first_name": { "type": ["string", "null"], "description": "First name of the user, if available" }, "identities": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "properties": { "type": { "type": "string", "description": "Type of identity (e.g., email)" }, "identity": { "type": "string", "description": "Identity value (e.g., email address)" }, "provider": { "type": ["string", "null"], "description": "Provider associated with the identity, if any" } }, "required": ["type", "identity"] }, "description": "List of identities associated with the user" }, "external_id": { "type": ["string", "null"], "description": "External identifier for the user, if available" }, "business_code": { "type": "string", "description": "Code representing the associated business" }, "organizations": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" }, "description": "List of organizations the user belongs to" }, "email_verified": { "type": "boolean", "description": "Indicates if the email address is verified" }, "password": { "type": "object", "properties": { "hashing_config": { "type": "object" }, "hashed_password": { "type": "string" }, "hashing_algorithm": { "type": ["string", "null"] } }, "required": ["hashing_config", "hashed_password"] } }, "required": ["id", "email", "created_on", "identities", "business_code", "organizations", "email_verified"], "additionalProperties": false } ``` Here's an example of `organizations.ndjson`. ```json { "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#", "type": "object", "properties": { "name": { "type": "string", "description": "Name of the organization" }, "created_on": { "type": "string", "format": "date-time", "description": "Timestamp when the organization was created" }, "business_code": { "type": "string", "description": "Code representing the associated business" }, "organization_code": { "type": "string", "description": "Code representing the organization" } }, "required": ["name", "created_on", "business_code", "organization_code"], "additionalProperties": false } ``` ## How passwords are exported As above, when passwords are exported, they appear as a hashed password, a hashing algorithm (e.g. bcrypt), and other hashing configuration details (e.g. salt and salt location). With this data you can authenticate against these credentials in another system using the same algorithm. Plain text passwords are never stored by Kinde for security purposes. ## Considerations if switching to another provider Kinde provides all your data in standard JSON files in a simple format. You will need to refer to the documentation of your new provider to establish what format the data needs to be in for importing. ## Data security Once your user data is exported and downloaded, it becomes your business’s responsibility to protect. When we export the file containing passwords, it is encrypted using AES-256-CTR. The file can only be decrypted if you have the unique Key and Initialization Vector (IV) provided during download. The encryption of the export file is designed to keep passwords secure during export, but once downloaded and decrypted, they become vulnerable.

# Manage your account - Your data - About your Kinde domain

> Guide to Kinde domains including domain allocation, custom domain usage, and domain management when deleting or recreating businesses.

kinde domain, custom domain, domain allocation, business deletion, domain reuse, scale plan, domain management, business registration
manage-your-account, your-data

When you sign up with Kinde, you also create a kinde domain, e.g. `yourbusiness.kinde.com`. Once in use, the Kinde domain is not available to anyone else. Even if you delete your business on Kinde, the domain remains allocated. We do not recommend deleting your business, if you want to keep the domain. ## Does the Kinde domain matter? Not really. Most founders and companies will use a [custom domain](/build/domains/pointing-your-domain/) to hide the "kinde" part. Even if you signed up with `testymctestface.kinde.com`, you can change your custom domain as many times as you like. If you're on a Kinde Scale plan, you can even have custom domains for orgs within your business. ## To change domains If you really want to change domains, you'll need to register a new business with the domain you want. Kinde cannot update the domain for your existing business. ## To start a new business but keep your domain It's pretty common for people to kick our tyres. So if you've been playing around on the Free plan and want to start fresh, you can [delete your business](/manage-your-account/your-data/delete-business/) in Kinde. Then to get the same domain back, you need to formally request that we make it free for you to use again. It's a bit of a process, so we ask you to give us at least a few days to sort it out. The business owner must make the request to free the domain by sending us an email to support@kinde.com, from the email they signed up with.
