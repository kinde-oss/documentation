We love that you want to help us with our docs in GitHub, so here’s our guidelines to help make this easier for you. The first thing to know is that Kinde has editorial discretion over all docs and we will review and edit community contributions to keep content in line with our styles and standards. Don’t let this stop you from raising issues or making suggestions - we need your expertise. We just don’t expect writing perfection, so we’ve got you covered. ## What to contribute Our docs describe what Kinde does, how our platform works, the core functions, configurations, features, settings, etc. We’re not trying to cover every use case, just the most common. Please raise an issue or suggestion if: - Something is incorrect and needs to be fixed - Something is under-explained and needs improvement - You find a gap in the docs or missing information What we are not looking for: - Product suggestions or feature requests - please log these [here](https://kinde-21631392.hs-sites.com/en-au/feature-request/) - Workarounds or solutions from third-parties - Non-specific feedback such as ‘bad doc, please improve’. ## Ways to contribute ### Raise an issue Let us know if a document is wrong or needs fixing. Be as specific as you can so we can address it quickly. An example is where a code snippet is incorrect, or a procedure is no longer working. For issues, provide: - Clear descriptive titles - Links to relevant pages/files - Explanations as to why (or *for whom*) this is a problem - Optional: proposed solutions ### Suggest a single page edit Suggest an improvement or change to a document by selecting **Edit this page** in your browser on the document. This will take you to GitHub where you can edit the content of the file and then create a pull request. As part of creating the pull request, make sure you explain why the changes are needed, who they help, and how. ### Raise a PR for bigger contributions We prefer to write the big stuff ourselves, so we encourage people to raise issues about gaps in our content and provide suggestions that way. However, if you want to create a new topic or edit multiple files, go to GitHub to create a branch or fork and raise a PR. There’s no guarantee your pages will be approved and merged, but we will review and get in touch to discuss and definitely consider new content for inclusion. ## Contributing to SDK documentation Our SDK docs are always evolving and we welcome suggestions and contributions to make them better. SDK docs are stored with our other docs (see the file structure below). The SDKs themselves are stored in separate [Kinde repos](https://github.com/kinde-oss/). ## General document structure Most Kinde docs follow a similar structure: - What is the topic about and who is it for (1-2 sentences) - Conceptual explanations with appropriate headings - Before you begin section for prerequisites - Procedure with steps - How to do x. - Supplementary or adjacent information - Related topics ## How we write Our documents are used by developers of varying experience, people from different language backgrounds, and users who are in a hurry to get the answer they need. Our guiding principle is to always use clear, simple language. Our docs are not translated currently, but they will be soon. Plain English makes translation easier. ### Writing principles - Use direct, clear sentences and short paragraphs - Use simple, plain vocabulary and phrases - Minimize jargon, idioms, and internet shorthand - Don’t make assumptions about what readers already know - Explain abbreviations and acronyms in full ### Content principles - Use short, descriptive headings that include keywords, so people can scan to find what they need. E.g. ‘Update redirect URLs’, instead of ‘Edit the .env file’. - Provide clear, step-by-step instructions that any level of user could follow easily. - Include conceptual explanations and use cases for complex topics. - Create tidy code snippets or examples that will help users get it right. ### Tone and voice - Take a friendly but casual tone, like you are explaining things to a peer or colleague. - Don’t waffle on too much with preamble, get to the point. - Speak with clarity and confidence. You know what you’re talking about. ## How to contribute to the Kinde docs ### Edit an existing article 1. Navigate to the doc in your browser and select **Edit page** at the bottom. GitHub opens. 2. Make the required changes and then **Commit**. 3. Provide clear and direct notes about your changes. 4. Submit a PR. [See below](/contribute/#raise-a-pr). ### Create a new document 1. Navigate to the folder of the section and subsection the topic will go. 2. Select **New file**. 3. Type the name of the file in the blank field and add .mdx. 4. Add the required frontmatter of the topic (`title` and `page_id`). See the [Docs syntax](/contribute/#docs-syntax) topic below. 5. Add content and commit. Explain the reason for the topic as part of the PR. ### File structure in GitHub Our documentation articles are written in `mdx` and are structured as follows: <FileTree> - src - content - docs - topic group - subtopic group - article-1.mdx - article-2.mdx </FileTree> ### Raise a PR When you're ready to raise a PR, use the following naming conventions: `feat:[description]` for new topics or substantial changes `fix:[description]` for corrections and minor changes This helps us recognize and prioritize requests. ## Docs syntax This section describes some of our styles, elements, and conventions for docs content. ### Frontmatter The header/metadata part of the content helps the article appearing correctly in docs. It is also important for external AI tools and search optimization. Copy the whole example below into the top of any new topic. And complete the required sections. Complete optional sections if you want. ```md title="src/content/docs/developer-tools/about/our-sdks.mdx --- page_id: title: description: "description" sidebar: order: relatedArticles: - - app_context: - m: s: topics: - - - sdk: [] languages: [] audience: complexity: keywords: - - - - - updated: yyyy-mm-dd featured: deprecated: ai_summary: --- ``` #### Required Fields **`title`** (string) - You must provide a title for every page. This will be displayed at the top of the page, in browser tabs, and in page metadata. **`page_id`** (uuid) - This is the internal unique `id` for the article. This will be used when referencing other articles within the `relatedArticles` frontmatter. You can use our [online UUID generator tool](https://kinde.com/tools/online-uuid-generator/) to use as the `page_id`. **`description`** (string) - A brief description of the article content, used for SEO and metadata. **`keywords`** (array) - Array of keywords for search optimization. #### Optional Fields **`order`** (number) - Control the order of this article when sorting an autogenerated group of links under a specific topic or subtopic. Lower numbers are displayed higher up in the link group. Providing the `order` frontmatter is completely optional and will be treated as a hint for us to where to place the file. We may update the article's `order` upon further review. **`topics`** (array) - Array of topic tags that help categorize the content. **`sdk`** (array) - Array of SDKs that are relevant to this article. Use `[]` for no SDKs or `null` for not applicable. **`languages`** (array) - Array of programming languages covered in the article. **`ai-summary`** (string) - A summary of the article content for AI processing and search. Can be same as description. **`relatedArticles`** (array) - Array of page IDs for related articles that should be displayed at the bottom of the page. ### Code samples The code snippets in our docs are powered by [astro-expressive-code](https://github.com/expressive-code/). Here are some examples in how you can use them: #### Regular syntax highlighting For code highlighting, you will need a language identifier. (See full list of [supported languages](https://github.com/shikijs/textmate-grammars-themes/blob/main/packages/tm-grammars/README.md) on GitHub) e.g. `js` for JavaScript: ````md title="example.mdx" ins=/^([^a-z]{3}.*)/ ```js console.log("This code is syntax highlighted!"); ``` ```` Will render: ```js console.log("This code is syntax highlighted!"); ``` #### Frames If you use a language identifier that is typically used for terminal sessions or shell scripts, a terminal frame will be added to the rendered output. ```` ```bash nano script.sh ``` ```` Will render: ```bash nano script.sh ``` If you add a value for `title`, then you get a title bar: ```` ```powershell title="PowerShell terminal example Write-Output "This one has a title! ``` ```` Result: ```powershell title="PowerShell terminal example Write-Output "This one has a title! ``` If the language identifier is not a terminal session or shell script one, providing the `title` attribute will render the frame with the file name, for example. ```` ```tsx title="src/app/page.tsx import { RegisterLink, LoginLink } from "@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs/components"; ``` ```` Output: ```tsx title="src/app/page.tsx import {RegisterLink, LoginLink} from "@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs/components"; ``` This can also been achieved by adding a comment with the file name at the top of your file. ````text frame="none" ```tsx // src/app/page.tsx import { RegisterLink, LoginLink } from "@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs/components ``` ```` Output: ```tsx // src/app/page.tsx import {RegisterLink, LoginLink} from "@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs/components"; ``` <Divider /> ### Images Use images sparingly, to support complex or detailed procedures. For accessibility, do not use images instead of text. Always include alt-text. If you need an image or screen shot in your article, you’ll have to: - Create a folder within `src/assets/images` with the same slug as your article (the article’s `.mdx` file name) - The image must be at least `1440px` wide - Include `alt text` in the markdown. Images are optimized before publishing, and have styles and zoom functionality added. For example, this article lives under `src/docs/contribute/index.mdx` - In this case, we would create a `contribute` folder under `src/assets/images` and save the image there. <FileTree> - src - assets - images - contribute - penguin.jpg </FileTree> To add an image to an article, just simply use the `markdown` syntax like so: ```md title="src/docs/contribute/index.mdx ![An image of a penguin](@assets/images/contribute/penguin.jpg) ``` The image will be rendered with some padding and will have the **click to zoom** functionality added to it. ![An image of a penguin](@assets/images/contribute/penguin.jpg) ## Components <Aside> We are slowly building a library of components to be used in our articles. You can see below a list of the ones ready to use — this list is constantly being updated. </Aside> ### `PackageManagers` This component combines multiple useful commands from different package managers in the `node` ecosystem. It generates commands for `npm`, `pnpm` and `yarn`. #### <span class="text-lg font-bold">`pkg` (required)</span> `string` — The package to be installed. For example: `@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs` #### <span class="text-lg font-bold">`type` (optional)</span> `add` `create` `exec` `run` `remove` default: `add` #### Example ```mdx <PackageManagers pkg="@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs" /> ``` #### Result <PackageManagers pkg="@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs" /> <Divider /> ### `Aside` This component is useful for displaying secondary information alongside a page’s main content. #### <span class="text-lg font-bold">`type` (optional)</span> `info` `warning` `danger` `upgrade` default: `info` #### <span class="text-lg font-bold">`title` (optional)</span> `string` default: `null` #### Example with title ```mdx <Aside type="warning" title="Attention"> This is the message </Aside> ``` #### Result <Aside type="warning" title="Attention"> This is the message </Aside> #### Example without a title and a type (defaults to the `info` variant) ```mdx <Aside> This is the message </Aside> ``` #### Result <Aside> This is the message </Aside> <Divider /> ### `FileTree` Use the `<FileTree>` component to display the structure of a directory with file icons and collapsible sub-directories. #### Example ```mdx <FileTree> - .env.local - src - app - page.tsx </FileTree> ``` #### Result <FileTree> - src - app - layout.tsx - page.tsx - dashboard - page.tsx - next.config.ts - .env.local </FileTree> <Divider /> ### `YoutubeVideo` This will embed a YouTube video using [`lite-youtube`](https://github.com/justinribeiro/lite-youtube) behind the scenes. #### <span class="text-lg font-bold">`videoId` (required)</span> The YouTube video `id`. `string` #### <span class="text-lg font-bold">`videoTitle` (optional)</span> The video title. `string` default: `"Video"` #### Example ```mdx <YoutubeVideo videoId="ybmHcAVBnec" /> ``` #### Result <YoutubeVideo videoId="ybmHcAVBnec" /> <Divider /> ### `Tabs` To create a tabbed interface use the `<Tabs>` and `<TabItem>` components. Tabs are useful for grouping equivalent information where a user only needs to see one of several options. #### <span class="text-lg font-bold">`<Tabs>: syncKey` (optional)</span> A key used to keep multiple tab groups synchronized across multiple pages. `string` #### <span class="text-lg font-bold">`<TabItem>: label` (required)</span> A tab item must include a label attribute set to the text that will be displayed in the tab. `string` #### Example ```text frame="none" <Tabs> <TabItem label="Stars">Sirius, Vega, Betelgeuse</TabItem> <TabItem label="Moons">Io, Europa, Ganymede</TabItem> </Tabs> ``` #### Result <Tabs> <TabItem label="Stars">Sirius, Vega, Betelgeuse</TabItem> <TabItem label="Moons">Io, Europa, Ganymede</TabItem> </Tabs> #### Example with code <Aside type="warning"> Depending on your `mdx` formatter, you may need to add extra space between jsx tags and the `TabItem` content. </Aside> ````text frame="none" <Tabs> <TabItem label="JavaScript"> ```text console.log("hello world!"); ``` </TabItem> <TabItem label="PHP"> ```php echo "hello world"; ``` </TabItem> </Tabs> ```` #### Result <Tabs> <TabItem label="JavaScript"> ```js console.log("hello world!"); ``` </TabItem> <TabItem label="PHP"> ```php echo "hello world"; ``` </TabItem> </Tabs>
