If you use properties to manage application data, you can edit property values manually in Kinde or via API. For example, you might want to associate an application with a specific internal ID to reference your systems. ## View the properties of an application 1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Applications**. 2. Select **View details** on the application whose properties you want to view. 3. Select **Properties**. ## Edit property values for an application 1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Applications**. 2. Select **View details** on the application whose properties you want to view. 3. Select **Properties**. 4. Select **Edit** next to the property you want to update. 5. In the window that opens, enter or edit the value. 6. Select **Save**. ## Manage properties via API You can also manage application properties via the [Kinde Management API](/kinde-apis/management#tag/properties).

properties, about-properties

Properties are a way for you to add custom data to Kinde, and then use that data for custom claims and in tokens. Kinde comes with a standard set of properties that make up business, user, application, and organization profiles, but you can also [add custom properties](/properties/work-with-properties/manage-properties/) to capture any data you like. For example, you might want to record a billing address separate to a delivery address, or capture screen names, job titles, or other customer information. Properties can also be used to create custom claims. ## Properties can be passed in tokens You can choose to make a property ‘public’ so it can be made available to be passed via a token. This is essentially a way of creating a custom claim, enabling data to be transferred system to system, via API. For more information see [Add and manage properties in tokens](/properties/work-with-properties/properties-in-tokens/). ## Kinde-included properties To get you started, we’ve included a set of common properties. You can easily identify these as the code key starts with `kp-` meaning Kinde-provided. You cannot edit or delete these properties. ## Custom properties The needs of every business are different, that’s why you can create your own properties and use them any way you want. For example, you might want to create a property to collect marketing information, identifiers from your app, or customer relationship data. ## Property categories Properties can be organized using [property categories](/properties/work-with-properties/property-groups/). When you create a category, it becomes a heading in a user, application, or organization record. Property categories ensure similar fields are grouped together for easier display. ### Organization properties example | Category | Properties | For | | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | | Billing information | Billing contact, Billing address, Billing phone | Organization | | Delivery information | Delivery contact, Delivery address, Delivery phone | Organization | ### User properties example | Category | Properties | For | | ---------------- | ------------------ | ---- | | Accounts contact | Name, email, phone | User | | Next of kin | Name, email, phone | User | ### Application properties example A common use case for application properties is to correlate M2M apps with organizations. | Category | Properties | For | | ----------- | ------------ | ---- | | Application org | Organization ID | Application | | External ID | External ID | Application | ## How properties are displayed in Kinde The way you label and group properties impacts how the data is displayed in Kinde. Here’s an example of how properties are displayed: <img src="https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/8250f7ea-f6a2-4c47-2e40-a824ef4f4800/public" alt="" width="672px" height="auto" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" decoding="async" /> ## Properties can be added and edited via API You need to [set up an M2M application to access the Kinde Management API](/developer-tools/kinde-api/connect-to-kinde-api/), and then create and edit properties using [dedicated endpoints](/kinde-apis/management#tag/properties).

For properties to be available in an application, user or organization record, they first need to exist in your business. This topic describes how to create and edit properties. Follow the procedure below to: - add properties for users - add properties for organizations - add properties for applications ## Add a property You can also create and update properties through the [Kinde Management API](/kinde-apis/management#tag/properties). 1. In Kinde, go to **Settings** **> Data management > Properties**. 2. Select **Add Property**. ![Top half of Add property window](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/14161413-5a55-4455-bdb7-87d00ae6d900/public) 3. Enter a **Name** for the property. 4. (Optional) Add a short description. Note that this description will appear when someone goes to edit the value of a property in a User or Organization record. 5. Assign a **Key** to the property. This needs to be unique so that you can identify it in your code. The key cannot be changed later. Note that any Kinde included properties start with `kp-`. 6. Select if the property needs to remain **Private**. If you switch this off, the property can be selected to be included in tokens. See [Add and manage properties in tokens](/properties/work-with-properties/properties-in-tokens/). ![Screen shot of botton half of property window](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/38738ae6-1f04-4973-0532-4653656c0f00/public) 7. Select if the property is for **Users**, **Applications**, or **Organizations**. 8. Select a **Category**. Use an existing one or create your own, see [Create property categories](/properties/work-with-properties/property-groups/). 9. Select the **Property type**. You can choose from Boolean, single line text, or multi line text. For more information, see below. 10. Select **Save**. ## Choosing a property type - Boolean: For when you want to indicate a true or false status, e.g. `paid_membership="true"` - Single line text: For including a short piece of info in a property, e.g. `membership_type="bronze"` - Multi line text: For including more substantial information, e.g. an address or business description. ## Include properties in tokens One of the powers of properties is being able to use them to [include custom claims in tokens](/properties/work-with-properties/properties-in-tokens/). To ensure a property can be used in tokens, make sure you switch off the **Private** option at step 6, in the procedure above. ## Edit or delete a property You can change the name and some property settings, but not all attributes can be edited. For example, you cannot change the property key once it has been created. You can also only delete the properties you created, not Kinde-created properties. <Aside type="warning"> Take care changing the availability of a property to be included in tokens, such as switching a property from public to private. This could cause a breaking change if the property is already used in tokens. See [Add and manage properties in tokens](/properties/work-with-properties/properties-in-tokens/). </Aside> 1. In Kinde, go to **Settings** **> Data management > Properties**. 2. Search or scroll for the property you want and select the three dots next to the property. 3. To edit, Choose **Edit property**, make the changes you want and select **Save**. 4. To delete, select **Delete property** then confirm that you want to delete.

# Properties - Work with properties - Add marketing tags using properties

> Comprehensive guide to using marketing tags as properties in Kinde including UTM tracking, Google Ads integration, and campaign analytics implementation

properties, work-with-properties

Marketing analytics relies on data about customer behaviour. This can include how a customer finds you, e.g. through a campaign, and what a customer does when they interact. Kinde allows you to pass marketing tag data in tokens, and store it as [properties](/properties/about-properties/) in Kinde. From here, you can extrapolate campaign success and other metrics you wish to track. ## What tracking tags are supported? Out of the box Kinde gives you 3 categories containing marketing properties which are available at both an organization and user level: ### UTM tags category Contains the following properties: * UTM source `utm_source` * UTM medium `utm_medium` * UTM campaign `utm_campaign` * UTM content `utm_content` * UTM term `utm_term` ### Google Ads smart campaign tracking Contains the following properties: * Google ID `gclid` * Google click ID `click_id` * HSA account `hsa_acc` * HSA campaign `hsa_cam` * HSA group `hsa_grp` * HSA ad `hsa_ad` * HSA source `hsa_src` * HSA target `hsa_tgt` * HSA keyword `hsa_kw` * HSA match type `hsa_mt` * HSA network `hsa_net` * HSA version `hsa_ver` ### Marketing category Contains the following properties: * Match type `match_type` * Keyword `keyword` * Device `device` * Ad group `ad_group_id` * Campaign ID `campaign_id` * Creative `creative` * Network `network` * Ad position `ad_position` * Facebook ID `fbclid` * LinkedIn ID `li_fat_id` * Microsoft ID `msclkid` * X ID `twclid` * TikTok ID `ttclid` ## Getting marketing tags into Kinde There are a few mechanisms for updating these property values in Kinde. ### Pass the tracking tags via the auth flow This is the most common method. For example, if you want to pass in the UTM source, you just need to forward the `utm_source` query parameter as part of the sign up flow authentication url. Most of our SDKs allow you to pass this in via additional URL params. For example in the React SDK: ```jsx <RegisterLink className="btn btn-dark properties={{ utm_source: "my source", utm_medium: "some medium", utm_campaign: "awesome campaign", utm_content: "something else", utm_term: "my terms", click_id: "1234" }} >Register</RegisterLink> ``` We automatically map the standard query parameters to the specific Kinde properties for you. For example `utm_source` URL param will be mapped to the `kp_usr_utm_source` Kinde parameter for a user and `kp_org_utm_source` for an organization. We map these automatically so that you do not need to make changes to the parameters in your code. The property values are set during the sign up flow for new users and at the point of organization creation for new organizations. ### Update the tracking tags manually * Via dashboard - Open a user or organization in Kinde, then select *Properties* from the side navigation. Update the relevant property. * Via the Kinde Management API - * [Update user property](https://docs.kinde.com/kinde-apis/management/#tag/users/put/api/v1/users/{user_id}/properties/{property_key}) - make sure to add `kp_usr_` as a prefix to the standard tag key. * [Update organization property](https://docs.kinde.com/kinde-apis/management/#tag/organizations/put/api/v1/organizations/{org_code}/properties/{property_key}) - make sure to add `kp_org_` as a prefix to the standard tag key. ## Accessing marketing tags data * Via dashboard - Open a user or organization in Kinde, then select *Properties* from the side navigation. * Via the Kinde Management API - * [View user properties](https://docs.kinde.com/kinde-apis/management/#tag/users/get/api/v1/users/{user_id}/properties) * [View organization properties](https://docs.kinde.com/kinde-apis/management/#tag/organizations/get/api/v1/organizations/{org_code}/properties) ## Check how specific marketing tags are performing Likely you will want to see which tags are converting into sign ups and are performing well. For this, you can use the User search API to return all users that match a specific property value. For example, if you wanted to see all users who signed up with a UTM source of "Hello" and a UTM campaign of "World" you could use this query: ``` /api/v1/search/users?query=properties[kp_usr_utm_source]=Hello&properties[kp_usr_campaign]=World ``` The search organizations API is coming soon.
