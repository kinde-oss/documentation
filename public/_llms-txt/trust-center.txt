We will charge your chosen payment method for the Subscription you have chosen and its corresponding Subscription fee (**Subscription Fees**) and usage fee (**Usage Fee**) on the day set out in your Account (**Payment Date**), or as communicated in writing to you. 2. The fee structure for our Platform is as set out on our website. The fees are charged based on your access to and use of the Platform.

Changes to your Subscription: If you wish to suspend or change your Subscription (for example, by upgrading to a different Subscription tier), you must provide notice to us through support channels or via email that you wish to suspend or vary your Subscription at least 7 days before the next Payment Date. If you vary your Subscription and the Subscription Fees increase, the increased Subscription Fees will apply on the next Payment Date, and you will have access to the additional Subscription features on the next Payment Date. If you vary your Subscription and the Subscription Fees decrease, the decreased Fees will apply on the next Payment Date, and you will lose access to the additional Subscription features on the next Payment Date. 10. Our pricing model does not incorporate any charges based on the number of team members or users associated with your Subscription and fees associated with usage are charged separately from the Subscription Fee as a Usage Fee, subject to clause 8(c). 11. To the extent permitted by law, the Subscription Fees and Usage Fees are non-refundable and non-cancellable once paid to cover our estimated losses resulting from the cost of resources spent in providing your our Platform and support services. 12. We may need to change what is available as part of your Subscription (for example, any plan change or feature removal) from time to time. If we change what is available as part of your Subscription, we will provide you with 30 days’ notice of the change. After 30 days, we will apply the changes to your Subscription. If the changes substantially and adversely affect your enjoyment of the Subscription, you may cancel your Subscription in accordance with the ‘Cancelling Subscriptions’ clause. If the changes are to your benefit, we will be deploying those new features and adjustments continuously at our discretion. 13. We may need to change the Subscription Fees from time to time. If we change the Subscription Fees, we will provide you with 30 days’ notice of the change. After 30 days, we may apply the updated Subscription Fee to your Subscription. If the updated Subscription Fee is not acceptable to you, you may cancel your Subscription in accordance with the ‘Cancelling Subscriptions’ clause. 9. **Beta Services** 1.

Termination of a Subscription will not affect any rights or liabilities that a Party has accrued under these Terms. 8. This clause will survive the termination or expiry of your Subscription. 21. **Modern Slavery** 1.

If you become aware of any actual or suspected occurrence of Modern Slavery in your operations or supply chains (or in those of any entity that you own or control), you must take reasonable steps to respond to the occurrence in accordance with any of your internal Modern Slavery strategy and procedures and any relevant policies, codes and standards (including any code of practice or conduct) or other guidance issued by any relevant Authority. 22. **General** 1. Assignment: Subject to the below clause, a Party must not assign or deal with the whole or any part of its rights or obligations under these Terms without the prior written consent of the other Party (such consent is not to be unreasonably withheld). 2. Assignment of Debt: You agree that we may assign or transfer any debt owed by you to us, arising under or in connection with these Terms, to a debt collector, debt collection agency, or other third party. 3.

Kinde takes data privacy and security very seriously. We want you to trust us and our systems, which is why we engaged in external certification audits and conducted self assessments against globally recognized privacy and security frameworks to ensure our technology infrastructure and your data are kept secure. ## **ISO 27001** ![ISO and ISO 27001 logos](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/6a57d6a4-8291-4b37-4449-6c38b010bf00/public) Kinde is [ISO 27001:2022](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001) certified by [Compass Assurance Services](https://cas.com.au/) and maintains an information security management system (ISMS) with a dedicated internal security team. Our public listing is available on the [JASANZ certified organizations register](https://register.jasanz.org/certificate-details/0/af0526d5-c2d8-ed11-a7c7-00224818a490) and the [IAF CertSearch register](https://www.iafcertsearch.org/certified-entity/WrSSvBtTuGl9ks9O9oyp30SO). You can also download a copy of our [ISO 27001:2002 certificate](/assets/images/docs/certificates/Kinde-Australia-ISO-27001-2022.pdf). ISO 27001 specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an ISMS within the context of the organization. This document also includes requirements for the assessment and treatment of information security risks tailored to the needs of the organization. ## SOC 2 Type 2 ![AICPA and SOC2 logos](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/99302f85-bdd0-482d-5e7e-caafb52bb900/public) Kinde has completed a SOC 2 Type 2 with report and attestation from [AssuranceLab](https://www.assurancelab.cpa/).

Access to the full SOC 2 report is part of our Scale and Enterprise plans. Reach out to our team if you need a copy and note that you will require an NDA as there’s sensitive information in the report. A [SOC 2 examination](https://www.aicpa-cima.com/topic/audit-assurance/audit-and-assurance-greater-than-soc-2) is a report on controls at a service organization relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy. SOC 2 reports are intended to meet the needs of a broad range of users that need detailed information and assurance about the controls at a service organization relevant to security, availability, and processing integrity of the systems the service organization uses to process users’ data and the confidentiality and privacy of the information processed by these systems. ## GDPR ![GDPR logo](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/64af5136-0785-402d-66b9-e6e3f3b8e000/public) Kinde is compliant with the GDPR and supports our customers by maintaining strict privacy principles as a Data Processor. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European Union (EU) regulation on information privacy. It came into effect on May 25, 2018 and places obligations for any company targeting or collecting data related to people in the EU. It’s goal is to increase privacy protections for individuals and standardise data privacy laws across the various EU member countries. More information about the GDPR and what Kinde does for comply with it can be found on our [GDPR](/trust-center/privacy-and-compliance/gdpr/) page. ## HIPAA ![HIPAA and AssuranceLab HIPAA logos](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/88d46614-1631-48ae-fcf4-a0ee7c121c00/public) Kinde is HIPAA compliant and supports our customers as a Business Associate. Reach out to our team if you need a Business Associate Agreement in place before working with us. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is a US federal law on how to protect sensitive health information, known as Protected Health Information (PHI), which led to the creation of the Privacy Rule and Security Rule. It has since been updated with additional rules and supplemented by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act in 2009. More information about HIPAA can be found on the US Department of Health and Human Services's [health information privacy](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html) page. ## CCPA and CPRA ![CCPA and CPRA logos](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/ffc476f3-6b5f-43ac-8406-d6ab5dce8100/public) Kinde is compliant with the CCPA (as amended by the CPRA) and supports our customers by maintaining strict privacy principles. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) gives consumers more control over the personal information that companies collect about them. The law took effect on January 1, 2020 (its initial regulations were approved on August 14, 2020) and applies to companies targeting or collecting data related to California residents. An amendment—the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)—expanded the CCPA’s scope; it became legally effective on December 16, 2020, most substantive provisions became operative on January 1, 2023 (with a look-back to data collected on or after January 1, 2022), and formal enforcement began July 1, 2023. More information can be found on the California Attorney General’s [CCPA/CPRA page](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) and the California Privacy Protection Agency’s website. ## **CAIQ v4** ![CAIQ self-assessment badge](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/ae7254c4-4fa9-4542-be17-86a2a3382d00/public) Kinde has completed a [Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ)](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/registry/kinde/services/kinde/) from the Cloud Security Alliance and submitted to their public STAR registry as a Level 1 self-assessment. Founded in 2013 by the Cloud Security Alliance, the Security Trust Assurance and Risk (STAR) registry encompasses key principles of transparency, rigorous auditing, and cloud security and privacy best practices. ## MVSP ![MVSP logo](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/c20625e4-2acf-43c4-e42e-66b853cafd00/public) Kinde has completed a Minimum Viable Secure Product (MVSP) self-assessment and implemented all recommended controls. Reach out to our team if you need to review our responses or have questions about specific controls. MVSP is a list of essential application security controls that should be implemented in enterprise-ready products and services. The controls are designed to be simple to implement and provide a good foundation for building secure and resilient systems and services. More information about MVSP can be found at the [Minimum Viable Secure Product](https://mvsp.dev/) website. ## PCI-DSS ![PCI logo](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/8358875d-ac43-43d3-f794-3d72bf3f1800/public) Please note that Kinde does not hold a PCI-DSS Report on Compliance (ROC) from a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA). In preparation for Kinde’s upcoming customer billing feature, we have engaged with a QSA to validate our scoping and we are preparing the necessary Self Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) to meet the PCI-DSS requirements for processing cardholder data. Currently we use a third party service provider and their SAQ-A scoped method, which greatly reduces the scope that Kinde has to meet as a PCI-DSS Service Provider. Our SAQ and Attestation of Compliance (AOC) will be available when scoping work is completed and will transition to a Level 1 Service Provider when the necessary transaction volume is reached. More information about PCI can be found at the [PCI Security Standards Council](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) website.

# Trust center - Privacy and compliance - General data protection regulation (GDPR)

> Detailed guide on how Kinde complies with GDPR requirements including consent management, data protection officer, encryption, privacy by design, and data subject rights.

GDPR, data protection, privacy, consent, data processing, encryption, privacy by design, data rights
trust-center, privacy-and-compliance, legal

Kinde is compliant with the GDPR and here’s how we do this. The list below are based on the key issues provided by [GDPR-Info](https://gdpr-info.eu/issues). They summarize the key issues facing companies in regard to data privacy protection. More information on the GDPR can also be found at [GDPR.EU](https://gdpr.eu/). Please note that this document is for guidance purposes only and is only updated occasionally. For the most up to date representation of our privacy stance, please refer to our [privacy policy](/trust-center/privacy-and-compliance/privacy-policy/). If you require a Data Processing Agreement (DPA), please reach out to our team at support@kinde.com. ## **Key issues** ### **Consent** <Aside> Processing personal data is generally prohibited, unless it is expressly allowed by law, or the data subject has consented to the processing. </Aside> Kinde processes personal data as part of our authentication product. Specifically first name, last name, and email address. Note that there may be less information provided depending on the type of authentication integration being used by our customers. For example, some social providers only provide the email or only provide a custom identifier without revealing any personal details. The consent for this is part of the terms between data subjects and Kinde’s customers. Kinde’s customers are the data controller, where as Kinde is only a data processor on behalf of our customer. With respect to marketing efforts, Kinde uses a legitimate interest assessment internally to determine broad scopes of marketing activities. ### **Data Protection Officer** <Aside> The GDPR has established the concept of a Data Protection Officer. </Aside> Kinde has nominated a Data Protection Officer internally, whose core responsibilities include ensuring Kinde is aware of, and trained on, all relevant privacy obligations, conduct audits to ensure compliance, address potential issues proactively, and act as a liaison with the public on privacy matters. You can reach out Data Protection Officer by emailing privacy@kinde.com. ### **Email marketing** <Aside> Newsletter mailings and e-mail marketing are a fixed part of the online marketing universe. </Aside> All marketing emails are sent with an opt-out link in the event that customers don’t want to receive products updates from us. Membership to the email marketing lists is collected when users voluntarily provide details to us, such as signing up for our product, registering for the newsletter, or signing up to blog post or product updates. ### **Encryption** <Aside> Companies can reduce the probability of a data breach and thus reduce the risk of fines in the future, if they chose to use encryption of personal data. </Aside> All customer data, including personal data, is encrypted at rest in Kinde’s production database using AES256. More information can be found on the [Security at Kinde](/trust-center/security/security-at-kinde/) page. Access to Kinde customer data and the back-end infrastructure is strictly limited and controlled. ### **Privacy by Design** <Aside> The term “Privacy by Design” means nothing more than “data protection through technology design.” Technical and organisational measures must be taken already at the time of planning a processing system to protect data safety. </Aside> One of Kinde’s product principles is Privacy by Design. In this effort, we have made a commitment to never sell our customer data. In addition to this, we’ve included privacy related checks throughout our software lifecycle to ensure that Kinde only collects the bare minimum amount of personal data to successfully run the product. ### **Privacy impact assessment** <Aside> This refers to the obligation of the controller to conduct an impact assessment and to document it before starting the intended data processing. </Aside> Kinde has completed privacy impact assessments for our key processing activities, which internally we’ve called a Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA), based on a template provided by the [UK’s Information Commissioners Office](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/accountability-and-governance/data-protection-impact-assessments/). They’re long and thorough, and have been extremely useful in mapping out the personal data being handled, but also influencing the business and technical strategies in protecting that data. ### **Processing** <Aside> The GDPR offers a uniform, Europe-wide possibility for so-called ‘commissioned data processing’, which is the gathering, processing or use of personal data by a processor in accordance with the instructions of the controller based on a contract. </Aside> As Kinde is a business to business (B2B) company, we handle personal data on behalf of our customers, which makes us a data processor. Our customers are the data controllers. As a result, Kinde takes instruction from the customers about what to do with the personal data. With respect to the customer, Kinde is a sub-processor for them. To review Kinde's sub-processors, please see [sub-processors](/trust-center/privacy-and-compliance/sub-processors/). ### **Records of processing activities** <Aside> Written documentation and overview of procedures by which personal data are processed. Records of processing activities must include significant information about data processing, including data categories, the group of data subjects, the purpose of the processing and the data recipients. This must be completely made available to authorities upon request. </Aside> One of the outputs from the DPIA mentioned earlier is a privacy data map, which includes records of processing activities (RoPA). Privacy surveys are conducted with each department to identify their own activities and what personal data is being handled. This captures information across user types such as customers, users, and employees. Once the surveys are done, the information is collated back into our RoPA and then updated as needed. ### **Right of access** <Aside> The right of access plays a central role in the GDPR. On the one hand, because only the right of access allows the data subject to exercise further rights (such as rectification and erasure). On the other hand, because an omitted or incomplete disclosure is subject to fines. </Aside> Due to Kinde being a processor of data and not the controller, the right of access for a data subject should be directed at Kinde’s customers. These companies should handle the privacy request and forward onto Kinde if there’s anything that we can do to assist. For the most part, Kinde will allow customers to view, adjust, or remove personal data for their users, such as user’s names or emails. ### **Right to be forgotten** <Aside> For the first time, the right to be forgotten is codified and to be found in the GDPR in addition to the right to erasure. </Aside> Refer to [Right of access](/trust-center/privacy-and-compliance/gdpr/#right-of-access). ### **Right to be informed** <Aside> There is a need for transparency regarding the gathering and use of data in order to allow EU citizens to exercise their right to the protection of personal data. </Aside> Refer to [Right of access](/trust-center/privacy-and-compliance/gdpr/#right-of-access).

Please refer to the [Kinde status page](https://status.kinde.com/) for uptime metrics. ## Backups Backups are performed at least daily to different storage for all production services and data. Databases holding customer data also have point in time recovery so that data can be retrieved from a particular update. Kinde performs restore testing at least annually to validate backup media and restore procedures. ## Business continuity and disaster recovery Kinde has documented and tested both our business continuity plan and disaster recovery plan. These are updated and refreshed at least annually to ensure that technical events such as a database failover or business impacting events such as a communications tool outage are understood with redundancy plans in place. ## Compliance Kinde holds a certificate of registration for ISO 27001:2022 and has a SOC 2 attestation. Please refer to our [Compliance certifications](/trust-center/privacy-and-compliance/compliance/) page for more information. ## Data residency Data is stored in the region you selected during sign up of our product. Currently the available regions are Sydney, Australia; Dublin, Ireland; Oregon, USA; and London, UK. The only data replicated between regions is backend metadata to facilitate the operation of the production services. Otherwise, all user data is not replicated between the regions and will remain in it’s original region. ## Denial of service Kinde uses a layered approach to protect it’s customers from denial of service attacks to the authentication pages and API, such as protections provided by AWS Shield, rate limiting rules with AWS WAF, and application based throttling. ## Encryption for data at rest All customer data at rest is encrypted in the Kinde production databases using the industry standard AES256 encryption algorithm. Encryption is facilitated by AWS KMS with access to administer KMS strictly limited to privileged admins. ## Encryption for data in transit All network traffic to Kinde production services uses TLS 1.2 or greater with a limited set of modern secure ciphers enforced. Security headers are applied to all production endpoints where possible. ## Identity management Internal identity is generally managed through the company’s single sign-on (SSO) platform provided by Google Workspace. All systems are connected to the company SSO platform where supported. Multi-factor authentication is enforced for all users and audit logs are enabled and monitored for systems connected to the company SSO. For systems that do not support SSO, employees are required to use the company provided password manager to generate and manage secure credentials as well as enable MFA for added protection. Access to systems is based on the employee’s job role with the least privileges assigned. Privileged access to any system is strictly limited based on the employee’s job role and accounts are individual to that user only. ## Penetration testing Kinde has completed a network and web application penetration test conducted by [Strike](https://strike.sh/), which was scoped for anything and everything related to Kinde. The test included common OWASP techniques and specifically targeted workflows such as privilege escalations, authentication bypasses, and cloud security. We intend to perform these at least annually. ## Security awareness All employees take part in a security onboarding session during their first week that covers topics such as acceptable use, phishing, data privacy, identity, endpoint protection, data classification, and incident response. ## Software development lifecycle All Kinde source code is managed by a company managed source code repository. Source code is scanned using a suite of open source tools, which will alert on insecure coding that could lead to vulnerabilities. Access to the source code repository is restricted based on job role with the identity linked to the company single sign-on platform. Merges to source code require a peer review. Pull requests to the master branch are performed by senior engineers. ## Vulnerability management Production services are deployed through a CICD pipeline using container technology. Server builds are done at least once a week and replace the existing servers. The build process will use the latest patched container host and container image to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities due to unpatched software. All container images are scanned at build using AWS Inspector for dependencies and third party library vulnerabilities. External production URLs and any public facing cloud IP addresses are scanned weekly for vulnerabilities by Intruder. All vulnerability reports are triaged, analysed, and assigned to the engineering team for remediation based on vulnerability management SLAs.
