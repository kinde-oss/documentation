ai_summary: Overview of Kinde's API key management system for customers to issue and manage API keys for their own APIs.
---

Kinde provides a comprehensive API key management system that allows you to issue and manage API keys for your own APIs.

This system supports both organization-level and user-level key management, making it suitable for B2B, B2C, and B2B2C business models.

This feature is available on [Kinde paid plans](https://kinde.com/pricing/)

## What are API keys?

API keys are long-lived credentials that allow end users to authenticate with your APIs.

They provide a simple way for users to access your services without going through OAuth flows and enables them to make requests outside of the browser, such as with CLIs, cURL.

### Key characteristics

- **Scoped**: each key is limited to a specific API
- **Permissions**: each key can be granted specific scopes/permissions
- **Secure**: keys are stored as secure hashes and never exposed after creation
- **Manageable**: keys can be created, rotated, and revoked as needed
- **Long-lived**: API keys don't expire unless you set an expiration date (coming soon)

## Key management models

### Organization-level keys

- Managed by organization administrators
- Suitable for B2B scenarios where customers need access to your APIs
- Keys are associated with specific organizations
- Admins can manage keys on behalf of their users

### User-level keys

- Managed by individual users
- Suitable for B2C scenarios where end users need API access
- Users create and manage their own keys
- Keys are associated with specific user accounts

## How API keys work

### 1. API registration

Before you can issue API keys, you must register your APIs in Kinde:

- Provide a name and description
- Define available scopes
- Get a unique `api_id` for each API

Read more about [API registration](/developer-tools/your-apis/register-manage-apis/).

### 2. Key creation

When creating an API key:

- Associate it with a registered API
- Assign specific scopes for access control
- Generate a secure secret (shown only once)
- Create a stable `key_id` for management

### 3. Key usage

End users include the API key in their requests to your API:

- Usually sent in an `Authorization` header
- Your API extracts the key and verifies it with Kinde
- Kinde returns validation results including scopes and metadata

### 4. Key management

Keys can be managed throughout their lifecycle:

- **Rotate**: generate new secrets while keeping the same key ID
- **Revoke**: mark keys as inactive
- **Update**: modify associated APIs or scopes (requires new key)

## Use cases

### AI and automation

- Enable AI agents to access your APIs
- Support automated workflows and integrations
- Provide secure access for machine learning applications

### Third-party integrations

- Allow customers to integrate with your platform
- Provide different access levels based on customer tier
- Track usage and enforce rate limits

### Internal automation

- Enable automated scripts and tools
- Provide secure access for CI/CD pipelines
- Support internal development and testing

### Partner access

- Grant partners access to specific APIs
- Control what data and features partners can access
- Maintain audit trails for compliance

### Developer tools

- Provide API access for developer tools and SDKs
- Enable self-service API exploration
- Support API testing and development

## Security features

### Secure storage

- API key secrets are never stored in plain text
- All secrets are hashed using secure algorithms
- No way to retrieve the original secret after creation

### Access control

- Keys are tied to a single API
- Keys can be granted specific scopes/permissions
- Organization-level isolation prevents cross-tenant access
