ai_summary: Enable API key management in the self-serve portal for both users and organizations, and use SDK helpers to deep link to the API keys section.
---

You can allow your customers to create and manage their own API keys directly in the self-serve portal for users and organizations.

## Switch on self-serve API keys in Kinde

1. Go to **Settings** > **Environment** > **Self-serve portal**.
2. Enable the API Keys option for the audience you want:
   - Users (B2C)
   - Organizations (B2B)
3. Select **Save**. An **API keys** navigation item will appear in the portal for your customers.

### Self-serve portal details

- [Self-serve portal for users](/build/set-up-options/self-serve-portal-for-users/)

## Deep link to API keys from your app

Most SDKs provide a `PortalLink` helper that generates a one-time portal URL and redirects the user. Use the `subNav` parameter to open the API Keys section directly.

### React

```jsx
import {PortalLink} from "@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-react";

// Opens the organization level API Keys section in the self-serve portal
<PortalLink subNav="organization_api_keys">Manage API keys</PortalLink>;
```

### Next.js

```jsx
import {PortalLink} from "@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs/components";

// Opens the API Keys section in the self-serve portal
<PortalLink subNav="user_api_keys">Manage API keys</PortalLink>;
```

### Without an SDK (server-side)

If you generate portal links using an API on your server, include a `sub_nav` field to deep link to API Keys.

```json
{
  "user_id": "kp_abc123", // or organization_code for org-level links
  "return_url": "https://yourapp.com/account",
  "sub_nav": "api_keys"
}
```

### Tips for setting up

- Use `subNav` (camelCase) in SDK helpers and `sub_nav` (snake_case) in API payloads.
- For organization-level experiences, pass organization context according to your integration pattern.

## Customer portal experience

After enabling the API key function for customers, an **API Keys** item shows in the portal navigation where customers can create, view, rotate and revoke keys.

## Access control for self-serve organization level API keys

There are system level permissions which Kinde provides which you can assign to your custom roles.

- `read:org:authentication` - The user is able to view API keys created by the organization
- `write:org:authentication` - The user is able to create, rotate and revoke API keys for the organization.

When assigning permissions to roles, our recommendation is to only give the minimum permissions required for someone to do their job. It is always better to be more granular in this area.
