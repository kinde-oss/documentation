In the Kinde model, we host everything except the payment processing part of billing. Kinde integrates with a third-party payment gateway (Stripe) for secure payment processing. 

This involves a continuous sync between Kinde and Stripe, to ensure that products, prices, subscription information, invoice and payments, are accurate in both systems. 

Kinde does not store payment details, such as credit card information. This is exclusively managed by Stripe.

## Billing for B2B and B2C

Kinde supports billing models for both B2B and B2C. Depending which you are setting up, you may need to do a few extra tasks. Most of the setup is common to both. We will call out tasks that are only relevant to one or the other.

- B2B - your customers are companies, organizations, or groups.
- B2C - your customers are individual users.

## Kinde and Stripe

Kinde integrates a single payment gateway (only Stripe for now) to handle the financial and payment management side of things.

Stripe uses the plan data + the customer info to create an agreement in Stripe. The customer is invoiced based on this agreement. Stripe securely stores your customer's payment details and Kinde never sees credit card or other bank information.

Here's what the billing feature looks like as a workflow.

Stripe is currently the only payment provider supported with Kinde. But we plan to expand to other providers in the near future.

## Multicurrency support

Kinde has customers everywhere and almost every global currency is supported. 

## Transaction data and Stripe region

- When you connect to Stripe in Kinde, we create a Stripe US account by default. We do this because Stripe US more widely supports global functionality. You can change the region during the Stripe connection setup flow. 
- Regardless of Stripe account region, you can still select any currency for your plans in Kinde, and Stripe will do the hard part of exchange rate conversion, tax calculations, etc.
- Any fees you incur in Stripe for international transactions are your sole responsibility.

<Aside type="warning" title="Financial compliance">

The region in Stripe indicates where the transaction information is held, so if all your business data must reside in one region, make sure you choose a Stripe region to meet your compliance needs.

## Billing and invoice cycles

Default behavior for invoices and charging is as follows. This cannot currently be changed.

- Billing cycles are monthly and are processed on the sign up anniversary
- Invoices include fixed charges in advance, e.g. a monthly subscription is payable each month in advance.
- Invoices include metered charges in arrears, e.g. MAU is metered throughout a month and then charges for the previous month appear on the next invoice.
