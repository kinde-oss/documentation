# Billing FAQ

Find quick answers to common questions about Kinde billing. Each section covers specific aspects of billing setup, management, and customer support.

## About Billing & Core Concepts

<details>
<summary>What is Kinde billing and how does it work?</summary>

Kinde billing allows you to monetize your product by creating subscription plans, processing payments through Stripe, and managing customer lifecycles. It integrates directly with your authentication system, so when users sign up, they can immediately select plans and start paying for your services.

The system handles plan creation, pricing tables, payment processing, subscription management, and customer self-service portals - all within your existing Kinde infrastructure.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What billing models does Kinde support?</summary>

Kinde currently supports monthly subscription billing with plans that can include feature limits, metered usage, and tiered pricing. The system is designed for SaaS and subscription-based business models, allowing you to create multiple plan tiers with different feature sets and pricing.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How does Kinde handle different currencies and billing cycles?</summary>

Kinde billing supports multiple currencies, but you must set your default billing currency before publishing your first plan. Currently, only monthly billing cycles are supported. The currency setting is permanent once you publish plans, so choose carefully during initial setup.
