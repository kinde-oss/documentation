You can build a pricing table to enable your customers to select plans and go through a payment flow as part signing up to your app or site.

Kinde's pricing table builder can generate a pricing table from published plans, or you can start with a blank one. 

You can also add and edit information and content in your preferred languages. You can create as many pricing tables as you want.

We recommend only doing this after your plans are finalized and published.

You can set a pricing table to show by default, even if the code key is not passed in the URL during the normal sign up flow.
