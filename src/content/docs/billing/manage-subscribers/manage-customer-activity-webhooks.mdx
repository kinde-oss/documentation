Kinde's billing webhooks are outbound calls Kinde makes to your specified endpoint when particular billing events occur. You can use them to keep your application synchronized with Kinde's billing events, trigger automated actions to provide a seamless experience for your customers, and reduce the load on your support team. 

## How Kinde webhooks work

Kinde webhooks use HTTPS REST to send information about events to a verified external URL that you provide. When an event is triggered, Kinde dispatches a JSON Web Token (JWT) containing relevant data to your registered endpoint. It's essential to verify the authenticity of this JWT to confirm the request originated from Kinde and then decode it to access the event data. If your endpoint doesn't return a 200 OK response, Kinde will retry the webhook call using a back-off policy. 

More about webhooks: Manage [Kinde webhooks](/integrate/webhooks/about-webhooks/) via the Kinde interface, or via the [Kinde Management API](https://docs.kinde.com/kinde-apis/management/#tag/webhooks).
