While we would rather customers didn't cancel their subscription to your services, they do need to be able to. There's two ways to do this.

- The customer can cancel via the self-serve portal
- You can cancel on behalf of a customer via API

<Aside>

  There is not currently a way to cancel via the Kinde UI

## How a customer can cancel their own plan

Customers can only do this if you have enabled plan management in the [self-serve portal](/build/self-service-portal/self-serve-portal-for-orgs/) and the B2B customer has a [billing role](/billing/get-started/add-billing-role/) that allows them to make changes. 

1. In your app or product, they open the self-serve portal for managing their account. Here's an example of where users (B2C) and organizations (B2B) can manage plans.

2. On the **Plan** page, they can scroll to the bottom and select **Cancel plan**.
3. They follow the prompts to cancel. This information is synced to Stripe. Depending on the [billing policies](/billing/manage-plans/upgrade-downgrade-plans/) you have set, they might receive a bill for unpaid usage, or be credited for unused subscription days.

## Cancel a plan via API

1. Get the customer's Agreement ID. This is the unique ID associated with their subscription in Stripe. You can find it in their Kinde record under Billing.
2. Using a DELETE request, hit the delete/api/v1/billing/agreements endpoint and include the `agreement_id` value in the call.

## Receive an alert when a customer cancels their plan

You can set up a workflow that enables you to check and approve cancellations. You might want to do this, for example, to be alerted when high value customers cancel.

For details, refer to the [Plan cancellation request workflow](/workflows/example-workflows/plan-cancellation-request-workflow/).
