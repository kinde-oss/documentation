---

This guide describes how to implement a **standard B2B SaaS architecture** in **Kinde** using:

- Organization-scoped access control
- Administrator-managed billing
- Fixed **per-user (seat-based)** pricing via metered features
- Multiple supported organization join patterns

This guide is intended for developers building B2B products on Kinde, who want to reproduce a typical organization-based billing model.

## Guide Overview

The recommended high-level implementation flow is:

1. Configure a per-user billing plan
2. Define who can manage billing at the organization level
3. Enable organization creation
4. Handle the first user (organization creator)
5. Allow additional users to join the organization
6. Track seat usage for billing

Kinde is **API-first and flexible**. Some organization join flows are supported out of the box, while others can be implemented using the Management API depending on product requirements.

## 1. Connect Stripe

Connect your **Stripe** account from the Kinde dashboard.

Notes:

- Test and live environments are supported
- Published plans are automatically synced to Stripe
- Stripe products and prices are managed by Kinde

**Learn more:** [Manage Stripe connection](https://docs.kinde.com/billing/payment-management/manage-stripe-connection/)

## 2. Configure a per-user billing plan

Create a billing plan with a **metered feature** representing users or seats. The plan must be created for **Organizations**.

### Create an organization plan

1. Go to **Billing**
2. Select **Add a plan**
3. In **This plan is for**, select **Organizations**
4. Provide a name, description, key, and currency
5. Save the plan


### Add a metered feature to the plan

1. In the plan, scroll to **Features and pricing**
2. Select **Add feature**
3. Choose **New metered**

Configure the feature:

- **Feature name**
    
    `Users`
    
- **Key**
    
    `user`
    
    This key is required when submitting metered usage.
    
- **Maximum units**
    
    Leave empty for unlimited users, or set a limit if required.
    
- **Unit measurement name**
    
    `user` or `seat`
    
- **Pricing model**
    
    Per unit
    
- **Price per unit**
    
    Fixed price per user
    
- **Line item description**
    
    Example: `User seats`
    

Save the feature.

### Optional: Add a base subscription charge

If your pricing model requires a fixed base fee:

- Add a fixed charge to the plan
- Example name: `Base subscription fee`
- The price can be `$0.00` if billing is fully per-user


### Publish the plan

Plans must be **published** before they:

- Appear in pricing tables
- Are selectable during signup
- Sync to Stripe

## 3. Generate a pricing table

1. Go to **Dashboard → Billing → Pricing tables**
2. Create or customize a pricing table
3. Toggle **Make live**

The pricing table key is required when initiating signup with plan selection.


## 4. Create a Billing Admin role

Organization administrators require a role that allows them to manage billing.

**Steps**

1. Go to **Settings → Roles**
2. Select **Add role**
3. Configure:
    - **Name:** Billing Admin
    - Key: billing-admin
    - **Assign to the creator if organizations self-sign up:** Enabled
    - **System permission:** `org:write:billing`
4. Save

Users with this role can manage subscriptions, plans, and payment methods for their organization.

## 5. Organization creation (first user)

Enable organization creation during signup.

**Settings → Environment → Organizations**

- Enable **Organization creation during signup**


### Trigger organization creation from your application

```jsx
<RegisterLink
  orgName="Paid Users Organization"
  isCreateOrg
  pricingTableKey="your_pricing_table_key"
>
Sign up your company
</RegisterLink>

```

### Direct authorization URL

```
https://<your_subdomain>.kinde.com/oauth2/auth
  ?response_type=code
  &client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
  &redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI
  &scope=openid profile email
  &is_create_org=true
  &pricing_table_key=YOUR_PRICING_TABLE_KEY

```


### Signup flow behavior

1. The user registers
2. A new organization is created
3. The user is assigned the Billing Admin role
4. The pricing table is displayed
5. Payment details are collected
6. The organization is created with an active subscription


## 6. Adding users to an existing organization

Once an organization exists, additional users can join using multiple supported approaches.

- The appropriate authentication method is enabled
- **Org → Policies → Allow org members to be auto-added** is enabled



### Option 1: Manual addition (dashboard)

- No custom code required
- Intended for internal or low-volume use



### Option 2: Self sign-up using `orgCode` (recommended)

Users sign up or log in using an organization code.

```jsx
<RegisterLink orgCode="org_8d350c10295bf">
Sign up
</RegisterLink>
```

```jsx
<LoginLink orgCode="org_8d350c10295bf">
Signin
</LoginLink>
```



Behavior:

- User authenticates
- User is automatically added to the specified organization

This is the **recommended default** for most B2B SaaS applications.



### Option 3: Auto-add users from allowed domains

Users are automatically added to an organization based on their email domain.

Enable:

1. Allow org members to be auto-added
2. Enable auto-add users from allowed domains
3. Add allowed domains (for example, `company.com`)

Example:

A user signing up with `jane@acme.com` is automatically added to the Acme organization.



## 7. Tracking seat usage for billing

Kinde does **not automatically calculate seat counts** for metered billing. Applications must submit usage updates.

### When to submit usage

Common triggers include:

- A user is added to an organization
- A user is removed or deactivated
- A scheduled reconciliation job (recommended)

### How to submit usage

Usage can be submitted using:

- Management API
- Workflows (example: [Track org seat usage workflow](https://github.com/kinde-starter-kits/workflow-examples/blob/main/billing/trackOrgSeatUsageWorkflow.ts))
- Billing webhooks

This ensures billed usage reflects the number of **active users** in the organization.


## Troubleshooting

### Pricing table not shown during signup

Verify:

- The pricing table is **live**
- **Settings → Billing → Billing experience → Show pricing table during signup** is enabled
- The `pricingTableKey` matches the intended pricing table
