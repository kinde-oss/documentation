This guide explains how to implement a **standard B2B SaaS billing architecture** using organizations, administrator-managed billing, and **per-user (seat-based) pricing** with metered features.

By the end of this guide, you will have:

- Organization-scoped access control
- A per-user billing model backed by metered features
- A billing admin role to manage subscriptions
- Multiple supported organization join patterns
- A strategy for tracking seat usage accurately



### What you need

- A Kinde account
- A Stripe account
- An application connected to Kinde
- Access to the Kinde dashboard



## Step 1: Connect Stripe

Connect your **Stripe** account from the Kinde dashboard.

1. Go to **Dashboard > Billing > Payment management**
2. Select **Connect Stripe**
3. Follow the Stripe onboarding flow

After connecting Stripe:

- Test and live environments are supported
- Billing plans published in Kinde automatically sync to Stripe
- Stripe products and prices are managed by Kinde

## Step 2: Create an organization billing plan

Create a billing plan that is scoped to **Organizations**.

1. Go to **Dashboard > Billing**
2. Select **Add a plan**
3. In **This plan is for**, select **Organizations**
4. Enter a name, description, key, and currency
5. Select **Save**

This plan represents the subscription that organizations will purchase.



## Step 3: Add a metered feature for user seats

Add a **metered feature** to represent per-user (seat-based) pricing.

1. Open the organization plan
2. Scroll to **Features and pricing**
3. Select **Add feature**
4. Select **New metered**

Configure the feature:

- **Feature name:** `Users`
- **Key:** `user`  
  This key is required when submitting metered usage.
- **Maximum units:**  
  Leave empty for unlimited users, or set a limit if required.
- **Unit measurement name:** `user` or `seat`
- **Pricing model:** Per unit
- **Price per unit:** Fixed price per user
- **Line item description:** `User seats`

Select **Save**.



## Step 4: Add an optional base subscription charge

If your pricing model requires a fixed base fee in addition to per-user pricing:

1. In the same plan, select **Add feature**
2. Select **Fixed charge**
3. Configure the feature:
   - **Name:** Base subscription fee
   - **Price:** Optional (can be `$0.00`)

![Base subscription fee](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/fbbe9660-8386-4791-f06b-52f7c787e900/public)

This allows you to combine a flat subscription fee with per-user billing.



## Step 5: Publish the billing plan

Billing plans must be published before they can be used.

1. Open the billing plan
2. Select **Publish**

After publishing, the plan:

- Appears in pricing tables
- Can be selected during signup
- Syncs to Stripe



## Step 6: Create a pricing table

Pricing tables allow users to select a plan during signup.

1. Go to **Dashboard > Billing > Pricing tables**
2. Create or customize a pricing table
3. Toggle **Make live**

Save the **pricing table key**, as it is required during signup.



## Step 7: Create a Billing Admin role

Organization billing should be managed by administrators.

1. Go to **Settings > Roles**
2. Select **Add role**
3. Configure the role:
   - **Name:** Billing Admin
   - **Key:** `billing-admin`
   - **Assign to the creator if organizations self-sign up:** Enabled
   - **System permission:** `org:write:billing`
4. Select **Save**

Users with this role can manage subscriptions, plans, and payment methods for their organization.



## Step 8: Enable organization creation during signup

Allow users to create organizations when signing up.

1. Go to **Settings > Environment > Organizations**
2. Enable **Organization creation during signup**



## Step 9: Handle the first user (organization creator)

The first user creates the organization and selects a plan.

### Trigger organization creation from your application

```jsx
<RegisterLink
  orgName="Paid Users Organization"
  isCreateOrg
  pricingTableKey="your_pricing_table_key"
>
  Sign up your company
</RegisterLink>
```

### Use a direct authorization URL

```bash
https://<your_subdomain>.kinde.com/oauth2/auth
  ?response_type=code
  &client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
  &redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI
  &scope=openid profile email
  &is_create_org=true
  &pricing_table_key=YOUR_PRICING_TABLE_KEY
```

### Organization Signup behavior

1. The user registers
2. A new organization is created
3. The user is assigned the Billing Admin role
4. The pricing table is displayed
5. Payment details are collected
6. The organization is created with an active subscription



## Step 10: Add users to an existing organization

Additional users can join an existing organization using multiple supported approaches.

Before enabling any join flow:

- Ensure the required authentication methods are enabled
- Go to **Org > Policies** and enable **Allow org members to be auto-added**

### Option 1: Manually add users (dashboard)

Administrators can add users directly from the dashboard.

- No custom code required
- Intended for internal or low-volume usage

### Option 2: Allow self sign-up using an organization code (recommended)

Users join by signing up or logging in with an organization code.

```jsx
<RegisterLink orgCode="org_8d350c10295bf">
  Sign up
</RegisterLink>
```

```jsx
<LoginLink orgCode="org_8d350c10295bf">
  Sign in
</LoginLink>
```

Behavior:

- The user authenticates
- The user is automatically added to the organization

This is the recommended default for most B2B SaaS applications.

### Option 3: Auto-add users from allowed domains

Users are automatically added based on their email domain.

1. Enable **Allow org members to be auto-added**
2. Enable **Auto-add users from allowed domains**
3. Add allowed domains (for example, `company.com`)

Example:

A user signing up with `jane@acme.com` is automatically added to the Acme organization.



## Step 11: Track seat usage for billing

Kinde does not automatically calculate seat counts for metered billing. Your application must submit usage updates.

### When to submit usage

Common triggers include:

- A user is added to an organization
- A user is removed or deactivated
- A scheduled reconciliation job (recommended)

### How to submit usage

Submit usage using one of the following:

- Management API
- Workflows  
  Example: [Track org seat usage workflow](https://github.com/kinde-starter-kits/workflow-examples/blob/main/billing/trackOrgSeatUsageWorkflow.ts)
- Billing webhooks

This ensures billing reflects the number of active users in the organization.



## Troubleshooting

### Pricing table not shown during signup

Verify the following:

- The pricing table is **live**
- **Settings > Billing > Billing experience > Show pricing table during signup** is enabled
- The `pricingTableKey` matches the intended pricing table



## Conclusion

You now have a complete B2B SaaS billing setup with organization-scoped access control, administrator-managed subscriptions, and per-user pricing using metered features.

From here, you can extend this architecture with additional metered features, scheduled usage reconciliation, or custom organization join flows using the Management API.
