Kinde's billing feature comes with a dependency on [Stripe](https://stripe.com), which is a known and reliable payments processing platform. A new Stripe account is automatically created for you when you set up billing in Kinde. 

<Aside type="warning">

You can't currently connect your existing Stripe account, but you will be able to copy across your business information from your existing account to the new account. This is a Stripe-imposed limitation for third party payment gateway integrations. We're working on a migration strategy.

</Aside>

1. If you are testing billing, switch to your non-production environment.
2. Go to **Settings > Environment > Billing**.
3. Select **Connect Stripe account**. Kinde initiates the connection and adds the connection card.

4. Select **Update Stripe information**. This kicks off a Stripe onboarding flow. You will see a Stripe-generated screen to enter details.

    <Aside>
    
    If the Stripe flow doesn't appear and you remain in the Kinde dashboard, select **Update Stripe information.**
    
    </Aside>
    
5. Enter the email that will be associated with the Stripe account and select **Submit**. Here's what happens next, depending if you have a Stripe account already associated with your email address.
    1. **If you are in the test environment**, you'll be prompted through a flow. You can continue or select **Return to Kinde**. 
    2. **If you are in a production environment,** you will be asked if you want to use details from an existing Stripe account or make a new one: 
        1. If you select existing, account details from the existing account will be used, but no other data will come across. 
        2. If you select to make a new one, you will be prompted to enter all your business details. This can take a while. 
        3. Follow the prompts as far as you want. Select **Return to Kinde**.
        
        <Aside>
        
        You can select **Return to Kinde** at any time. You do not have to set up the connection fully until you are ready to publish plans. Any time you want to complete the setup, select **Update         Stripe information**.
        
        </Aside>
        
6. When you complete the Stripe onboarding, or opt out by selecting **Return to Kinde**, the connection card on the Kinde **Billing** page shows the connection status.

    - `Connecting`  means Stripe is still sending information to Kinde about the account status. It should not take long to sync.
    - `In progress`  indicates that Stripe has connected to Kinde, but still requires some additional details from you in order to fully set up the account. Select **Update Stripe information** to complete the Stripe onboarding. You need to do this before plans can be made available to your customers.
    - `Connected` means Stripe is successfully syncing data with Kinde and you're ready to publish plans.
