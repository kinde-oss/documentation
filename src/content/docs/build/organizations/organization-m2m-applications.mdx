---

If you want to give automated systems, AI agents, or backend services access to data in a specific organization, you can do this securely using an **organization-scoped machine-to-machine (M2M) application**.

This type of app is tied to a single organization and can only be used to access resources for that org.

To create an org-scoped M2M app:

1. In Kinde, go to **Organizations**, then select the organization.
2. Select **Machine-to-machine apps**.
3. Follow the steps to create the app and assign the appropriate scopes.

For full details, see [M2M access scoped to organizations](/machine-to-machine-applications/organization-scoped-m2m-apps/m2m-applications-for-organizations/).
