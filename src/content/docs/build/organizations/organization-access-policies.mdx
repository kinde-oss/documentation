âš¡ This is an advanced feature that is only available on the [Kinde Scale plan](https://kinde.com/pricing/). You can apply policies for 5 orgs, and then charges apply.

You can set policies for an organization to control access to the organization. When you set policies for an organization, this overrides any [policies set at the environment level]. 

Organization policies can include:

- Whether people can sign up to an organization
- Allowed domains for signing up to the organization
- Whether users from allowed domains are auto-added to the organization

## To set policies for an organization

You may need to activate some features as you go.

1. In Kinde, go to **Organizations**.
2. Browse or search for the organization.
3. In the list, select the organization to open the details page. 
4. Select **Policies** in the menu.
5. If you want users to be able to sign up or register to the organization, select **Allow self sign-ups**.
6. (Only in the default organization) Choose if you want to **Add users to the default organization if no organization is specified** on sign up.
7. If you want to restrict which domains can sign up to this organization, enter domains in the **Allowed domains** list. Use the format `domain.com` and not `https://www.domain.com`. If you leave this empty, users from any domain can sign up.
8. Select if you want to **Auto-add users from allowed domains**. 
9. Select **Save**.
