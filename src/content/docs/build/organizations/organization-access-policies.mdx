<Aside type="upgrade">

This is an advanced feature that is only available on the [Kinde Scale plan](https://kinde.com/pricing/). You can apply policies for 5 orgs, and then charges apply.

</Aside>

You can set policies for an organization to control access to the organization. When you set policies for an organization, this overrides any [policies set at the environment level](/build/set-up-options/access-policies/).

This topic provides instructions for the following tasks:

- Allow anyone to join the organization
- Only allow users from specific domains to sign in to the organization (i.e. apply domain restrictions for an organization)
- When users from specific domains sign up, add them as members to this organization
- Assign specific roles to new members of an organization

## To set policies for an organization

You may need to activate some features as you go.

1. In Kinde, go to **Organizations**.
2. Browse or search for the organization.
3. In the list, select the organization to open the details page.
4. Select **Policies** in the menu.
5. If you want users to be able to join this organization if they pass the correct `org_code`, select **Allow org members to be auto-added**.
6. (Only in the default organization) Choose if you want to **Add users to this organization if no organization is specified** on sign up.
7. (Only if you switched on auto-adding at step 5) To restrict users from joining the organization unless they belong to an allowed domain, enter domains in the **Allowed domains** list. Use the format `domain.com` and not `https://www.domain.com`. If you leave this empty, users from any domain can sign up.
8. Select if you want to **Auto-add users from allowed domains**.
9. In the **Default roles** section, select which roles will be assigned to new members when they sign up.

10. Select **Save**.

## Policy setting quick reference

Note that your selections for each organization override the [global policy settings](/build/set-up-options/access-policies/).
