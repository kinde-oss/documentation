By default, Kinde issues a Kinde subdomain when you first register. But for your production environment you can use your own custom domain instead of Kinde’s as your URL. For example, `account.example.com` instead of `mydomain.kinde.com`.

There are a few reasons you may wish to do this.

- It will give your users the impression they have never left your application to authenticate, creating a seamless user experience.
- For Single Page Applications (SPAs) it means we can securely set a first party cookie meaning authentication state persists for full-page refreshes and new tabs.
- If you also register the domain in the configuration for any social providers you are using, the social providers auth screen will be customized with your app details.

<Aside title="When to still use the Kinde domain">

Even if you use custom domains, you need to use your Kinde domain for Kinde Management API access and machine-to-machine applications.

</Aside>

## Before you begin

- Name your custom domain. It needs to include a subdomain for this procedure to work. Common subdomain names include `account` , `id` , or `auth`, e.g. `account.example.com`.
- Make sure your application is configured to use the exact custom domain. This includes updating the environment variables and any relevant configuration files. For example, the KINDE_ISSUER_URL needs to be updated to the custom domain.
- Ensure that the callback and logout redirect URLs in your Kinde settings are updated with the custom domain. This can be done in the Kinde dashboard under Settings > Applications > [your app] > View details.

## Set up in Kinde

Note that the verification process can take anywhere from 5 minutes to a few hours, depending on who your domain provider is. See [tips for the DNS set up](/build/domains/pointing-your-domain/#tips-for-the-dns-set-up) below.

1. Go to **Settings > Environment > Custom domain**.
2. Select **Add custom domain**
3. In the dialog, enter your custom domain. Be sure to include the subdomain, for example `account.example.com`.
4. Select **Save**. DNS details appear. You need to add these to your domain provider site.

## Add CNAME DNS records

1. Go to your domain provider website.
2. Create CNAME DNS records using the DNS details generated above. 

Apologies that we can’t offer instructions for all situations, as this will be different depending on your provider. But here are the setup steps for [Godaddy](https://au.godaddy.com/help/add-a-cname-record-19236), [Cloudflare](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/adding-dns-records/52718), and [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9646/2237/how-to-create-a-cname-record-for-your-domain/).

   Cloudflare users: DNS entries must be DNS-only, not proxied.

   </Aside>

## Check verification status in Kinde

Once you have created the DNS entries, Kinde will start the verification process. This can take anywhere from a few minutes to a couple of hours. When it completes, the verification status will change to 'Provisioned' and an SSL certificate will be provisioned. 

Your domain will then be used instead of Kinde’s. You will also receive an email notification when the process is complete.

If you encounter any errors, such as the verification taking too long, re-check the DNS records you created on your provider site, to ensure the details are correct.

<Aside type="warning">

The challenge DNS record needs to remain in place after verification in order for us to renew your SSL certificate on an ongoing basis.

## Update your code

- Update your code to use the custom domain.

## Add the custom domain to social sign in

When you use social connections to authenticate users, you need to add the callback URL to the provider app so that the custom domain shows on the sign in form, instead of kinde.com.

  alt="
  width="672px"
  height="auto"
  fetchpriority="low"
  loading="lazy"
  decoding="async"
/>

If you haven't set this up, follow these instructions for the [relevant social provider](/authenticate/social-sign-in/add-social-sign-in/).
If you already have social auth set up, make sure you add the custom domain callback (e.g. `account.example.com/login/callback` as an authorized redirect URI in the provider app.

## Domains and auth end points

Auth endpoints are available for both custom domains and your Kinde subdomain. You can get tokens from either end point, but they are not interchangeable. For example, if you get an ID and access token from `account.example.com`, it cannot be used with `mydomain.kinde.com`.

## Local domain

Currently, Kinde only supports `*.localhost` for non-https traffic.

## Tips for the DNS set up

When you create the DNS records for linking your own domain to Kinde, be sure to match the format you have used above.

For example, if your custom domain is `account.example.com`, then:

Host = `account`

Record type = `CNAME`

Value = `account.example.com`

TTL = Leave as default

Routing policy = Leave as default

## Using multi-level subdomains

If you are using a multi-level subdomain, like `multi.subdomain.example.com`, how you set up DNS records will depend on how your zones are set up.

The details provided in the admin console assumes the domain entered is adding a single level to your DNS zone, but if you are adding more than one level you’ll need to create others.

So if your business is `multi.subdomain.example.com` and your zone is `example.com`, you need to create a DNS entry for `multi.subdomain`, as well as for `_acme-challenge.multi.subdomain`.

/>

There are many different ways people manage multi-level domains and zones, and unfortunately we can’t cover all variations in these instructions.
