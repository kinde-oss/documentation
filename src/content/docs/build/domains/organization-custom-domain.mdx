<aside type="upgrade">
⚡ This is an advanced org feature that is only available on the [Kinde Scale plan](https://kinde.com/pricing/). Charges apply for each organization that uses [advanced org features](/authenticate/custom-configurations/advanced-organization/).

When you add a custom domain to an organization, it sets the domain URL for authentication to the custom domain, instead of a Kinde domain address. For example `customdomain.com` instead of `org.business.kinde.com`.

Kinde currently supports a single custom domain per organization.

## Step 1: Add the custom domain to the organization

1. In Kinde, go to **Organizations**.
2. Browse or search for the organization.
3. In the list, select the organization to open the **Details** page. 
4. Select **Custom domain** in the menu.
5. Select **Add custom domain** and enter the custom domain you want.
6. Select **Save**. The DNS details are generated. Use them to add DNS records to your domain provider site.

## Step 2: Add DNS records to your domain provider site

Instructions will vary depending on your domain provider. Here’s the general process. 

1. Sign in to your domain provider admin portal.
2. Navigate to the page where you can add DNS records. 
3. Use the details provided by Kinde to add CNAME DNS records.

## Step 3: Monitor for verification and SSL certificate provisioning

1. Open the individual organization record.
2. Select **Custom domains**.
3. The custom domain panel DNS records shows the current verification status. The verification process can take up to a couple of hours. When it completes, the verification statuses will change.
    - Unverified
    - Verification in progress
    - Verified
    - Verification failed
    
    Once record verification is complete, an SSL certificate can be provisioned. 
    
    If verification fails, check that your records are correct on your domain provider site and try again.
    
5. These are the SSL certificate provisioning statuses you might see:
    - Unprovisioned
    - Provisioning in progress
    - Provisioned
    - Provisioning failed
    
    Once successfully provisioned, your custom domain will then be used for this organization. 
    

## Troubleshoot custom domain issues

If you encounter any errors, such as the verification taking too long, re-check the DNS records you created on your provider site, to ensure the details are correct.

### Tips for the DNS set up

When you create the DNS records be sure to match the format and details provided in Kinde. 

For example, if your custom domain is `account.mydomain.com`, then:

Host = `account`

Record type = `CNAME`

Value = `account.mydomain.com`

TTL = Leave as default

Routing policy = Leave as default

### Using multi-level subdomains

If you are using a multi-level subdomain, like `multi.subdomain.domain.com`, how you set up DNS records will depend on how your zones are set up. 

The details provided in the admin console assumes the domain entered is adding a single level to your DNS zone, but if you are adding more than one level you’ll need to create others.

So if your business is `blue.black.red.com`, you need to created a DNS entry for the custom domain `blue.back.red`, as well as an `_acme-challenge.blue.black.red` domain.

## Remove a custom domain for an organization

<aside type="warning">
⚠️ If your users are already signing in through a custom domain, removing it can break their authentication experience.

</aside>

1. Open the **Organization** record in Kinde.
2. Select **Custom domain** in the menu.
3. In the custom domain details area, select the three dots menu and then select **Remove custom domain**. Respond to the confirmation message.
