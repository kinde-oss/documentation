Customer support is one of the higher overheads for a SaaS business. For paying customers, the expectation is that they get help when needed, for example, to manage their account or get assistance with your app.

Kinde lets you configure a self-serve portal so authorized customers can self-manage functions provided by Kinde. This means your customers can make account changes without contacting you for support, saving everyone time and money.

There's two types of portal: one for end users (B2C), and one for organizations (B2B).

## Self-serve portal for organizations

In the organization portal, you can allow org members to manage:

- Account details
- Payment details (if you have billing set up)
- API Keys (Paid plans)
- Members and roles (Coming soon - Paid plans only)
- SSO enterprise connections (Coming soon - Kinde Scale plan only)

You can enable all functions or limit them to what you offer. [Set up a self-serve portal for an org](/build/self-service-portal/self-serve-portal-for-orgs/)

<Aside>
  
If you are on the Kinde Scale plan, you can configure the [portal per organization](/build/organizations/self-serve-portal-per-org/). E.g. allow some functions for some customers and not others.

## Self-serve portal for users

In the user portal, you can allow users to manage:

- Account details
- Payment details (if you have billing set up)
- Multi-factor auth settings (coming soon)
- API Keys

[Set up a self-serve portal for users](/build/set-up-options/self-serve-portal-for-users/)

## Self-serve portal settings

These are the self-serve portal settings you can enable.

## Current limitations

Currently, we don't support any customer design for the portal appearance. However, you can build your own portal and use the [Kinde API](https://docs.kinde.com/kinde-apis/management/) endpoints to provide the functions.
