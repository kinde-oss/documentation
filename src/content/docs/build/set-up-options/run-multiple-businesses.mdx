You can run multiple businesses on Kinde. This is helpful if you want to create different businesses with different user groups. For instance if you are a founder working on multiple applications, or you also run a business in a different region. Organizations, users, branding, and activity are all managed separately.

## **Add a new business**

1. In the **Business** menu at the top of the page, choose **Switch** **business.**
2. Select **Add business**.
3. Complete the form, including your preferred Kinde domain.
4. Select a **Region**. This is where your data is stored on Kinde.
5. Select **Save**.

## **Switch between businesses**

1. In the **Business** menu at the top of the page, choose **Switch** **business.**
2. Select the business you want to work on.

## Delete a business

You can only [delete your own business](/manage-your-account/your-data/delete-business/) if you are on a free plan. You need to email [support@kinde.com](mailto:support@kinde.com) to downgrade from a paid account before deleting.

Deleting a business is a nuclear and irreversible action, so make sure you export all your important data before doing this.
