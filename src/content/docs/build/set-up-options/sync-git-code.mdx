To use workflows and other BYO code features, you need to sync your git-stored code to Kinde. Currently, Kinde only syncs with Github, but other providers will be added as the feature progresses.

## Change the git repo

If you are connecting your repo to Kinde for the first time, see [Connect your workflows repo and branch](/workflows/about-workflows/connect-repo-for-workflows/)

1. Go to **Settings > Git repo**.
2. Select **Change repo**
3. Follow the steps to add your repo, select the branch, etc.
4. If you are on an eligible plan, switch on the code preview option in **Advanced settings**. This lets you preview newly deployed code before making it live.
5. Select **Save**.

## Preview workflow code

If you are on an eligible plan, we recommend enabling code preview for your workflow. This lets you [test deployed code](/workflows/manage-workflows/test-workflows/) before you make it live for customers.

1. Go to **Settings > Git repo**.
2. Select the **Enable preview mode** option.
5. Select **Save**.

<Aside type="warning">

If the preview mode option is switched off, your code will be pushed live automatcially each time you sync.
