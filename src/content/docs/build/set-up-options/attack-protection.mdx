Attack protection is always on, and Kinde ships with sensible defaults to keep your product protected without you lifting a finger. There are some things you can configure.

## Set brute force protection

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Attack protection**.
2. Select **Brute force protection**.
3. Set how many sign-in attempts users get before being locked out of their account. You can choose the Kinde default of 5 or set a custom amount.
4. Set how long the account lockout lasts before users can sign in again. You can accept the Kinde default of 5 minutes or set a custom time, up to 60 minutes.
5. Select **Save**.

## What counts as a failed sign-in attempt

- incorrect password entered
- incorrect OTP code entered
- incorrect recovery code entered
- incorrect MFA response entered
