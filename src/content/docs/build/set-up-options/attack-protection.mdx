Kinde gives you control over user security by allowing you to set brute force protection response measures.

## Set brute force protection

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Attack protection**.
2. Select **Brute force protection**.
3. Set how many sign-in attempts users get before being locked out of their account. You can choose the Kinde default of 5 or set a custom amount.
4. Set how long the account lockout lasts before users can sign in again. You can accept the Kinde default of 5 minutes or set a custom time, up to 60 minutes.
5. Select **Save**.

For general information about Kinde security, practices, and policies, see the [Trust Center](/trust-center/security/security-at-kinde/).
