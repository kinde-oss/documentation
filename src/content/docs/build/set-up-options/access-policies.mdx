This topic is about setting user access policies at the environment level. If you want to apply user access policies per organization, see [Set access policies for an organization](/build/organizations/organization-access-policies/)

Policies include:

- Whether users can self sign up
- Whether organizations can be created on sign up
- Allowed domains for signing up
- User profile sync option

## Set policies for all organizations

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Environment > Policies**.
2. If you want users to be able to sign up or register to your application, select **Allow self sign-up**.
3. If you want to restrict which domains can sign up to your applications, enter domains in the **Allowed domains** list. Use the format `domain.com` and not `https://www.domain.com`. If you leave this empty, users from any domain can sign up.
4. Choose if you want to **Allow organization creation on sign up**. This is common for B2B businesses.
5. Select **Sync user profiles on sign in** if you want to keep basic user profile data provided by third-party sources (like Google, GitHub, etc.) in sync with Kinde profiles. You only need to select this if you allow sign-up and sign-in using social providers.
6. Select **Save**.

## Policy setting quick reference

Note that global access policies can be overriden at the individual organization level if you are on a [Kinde Scale plan](https://kinde.com/pricing/) and activate the Advanced organization feature.
