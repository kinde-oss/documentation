Refresh tokens are used to request new access tokens.

Access tokens are issued when a user makes an authentication request or a call is made to an API. An access token gives permission to enter and interact with a system.

## How refresh tokens work

Access tokens usually have an intentionally short lifetime. However, rather than having a user need to re-authenticate frequently, a refresh token can be used to request a new access token. Refresh tokens operate without user intervention, extending session access without the same security risk as requesting a new access token.

Refresh tokens can be used a finite amount of times before re-authentication is required.

## How to get a refresh token

To get a refresh token, you need to include the `offline` scope when you initiate an authentication request through the `https://<your_subdomain>.kinde.com/oauth2/auth` endpoint. You also need to initiate Offline Access in your API.

Details on how to do this is provided in [our SDKs](/developer-tools/about/our-sdks/), but here’s how to do it yourself.

Below is an example using the Authorization Code grant, with the `offline` scope being one of the scopes passed to the authentication request.

```jsx
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
    -d "response_type=code&client_id=your_client_id&redirect_uri=your_redirect_uri&scope=offline%20email%20openid%20profile&grant_type=authorization_code" \
    https://<yoursubdomain>.kinde.com/oauth2/auth
```

Refresh tokens are stored in sessions. When a session needs to be refreshed (for example, a pre-defined time has passed), the app uses the refresh token on the backend to obtain a new access token, using the `https://<your_subdomain>.kinde.com/oauth2/token` endpoint with `grantType=refresh_token`.

**Example of a refresh token response**

```jsx
{
	"access_token": "hju76F...P8rTh63Ute",
	"refresh_token": "VOe264go...oLp2dC6",
	"token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

## Refresh token rotation

Kinde always rotates refresh tokens. When you use an existing refresh token to request a new access token, a new refresh token is also generated and provided with your new access token. The old refresh token becomes immediately invalid.

## Auto-update of refresh tokens

Kinde allows a small overlap period when both a previous and new refresh token is valid. This is to account for retries and bad network connections. You can [set the lifetime of a refresh token](/build/tokens/configure-tokens/) in Kinde. It needs to be longer than the life of an access token.

## Refresh tokens when you are not using an SDK

You should store the refresh token you get with your initial `/token` request. Otherwise, your user will need to go through the sign in process again, to get a new access token.

## Refresh tokens when you are using a front-end SDK

If you’re using a front-end SDK like [JavaScript](/developer-tools/sdks/frontend/javascript-sdk/) or [React](/developer-tools/sdks/frontend/react-sdk/), the `getToken` function stores an in-memory cache of the access token, which it returns by default. If the token is about to expire it will use a refresh token to get a new access token from Kinde silently in the background so additional network requests to Kinde are only made when absolutely necessary.

## Token security recommendations

Token security can be approached in a number of ways. We recommend at least covering the basics of:

- keeping the number of refresh tokens within a manageable limit to keep credentials safe and secure.
- storing refresh tokens securely in the back-end of your application because they essentially allow a user to remain authenticated forever.
- employing refresh token rotation and automatic reuse detection for added security.
