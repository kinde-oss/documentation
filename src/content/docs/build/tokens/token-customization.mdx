If you want to include additional information in tokens, you can customize access tokens, M2M tokens, and ID tokens using preset custom claims. If you need Kinde token formats to be third-party friendly, you can also enable mapping for those services, e.g. Hasura.

Token customization is a step toward enabling custom claims, but it is not the same thing.

## Select information to add to token

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Applications** and select **Details** on your application.
2. Select **Tokens**, then scroll to the **Token customization** section.
3. On the relevant token type card, select **Customize**. A selection window appears.

4. Select the available **Additional claims** and **Properties** you want to include in the token.
5. Select **Save**.

## Available additional claims
Apart from your own [custom properties](/properties/work-with-properties/properties-in-tokens/), you can add some out of the box additional claims to tokens.

For access tokens:
- Organization name
- Roles
- Email
- External organization ID

For ID tokens:
- Social identity
- Organizations

For M2M tokens:
- Feature flags

## Token integration for third parties

Currently, we only support formatting for Hasura.

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Applications** and select **Details** on your application.
2. Select **Tokens.**
3. Scroll to the **Token integrations** section and switch the toggle on for the platform you use.
4. Select **Save**.
