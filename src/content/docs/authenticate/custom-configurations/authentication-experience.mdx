Kinde aims to give you as much control of your user’s sign up and sign in experience as possible, without compromising security. Here are some options for customization in your applications.

You’ll find these in Kinde: **Settings > Applications > View details** on your application.

## Use your own sign up and sign in screens

Kinde offers custom authentication, allowing you to use your own sign up and sign in screens, bypassing the landing screens provided by Kinde. You can enable this for social sign in, email, phone, enterprise connections, or any combination of these sign up methods you support.

See [Custom sign-up and sign-in pages](/authenticate/custom-configurations/custom-authentication-pages/) for more details.

## Create a unified sign-up / registration experience (seamless sign up)
You can allow all users to register and sign from the same authentication screen, without forcing them to create an account first. 
To do this:

1. Update your app to redirect all authentication through the registration flow.
2. Switch off the requirement to ask for first name and last name on registration (see section below).
3. Go to **Settings > Applications > View details** on your application. Scroll to the **Authentication experience** section. Switch on the **Do not show 'Already have an account? Sign in' on registration page** option.
4. Go to **Design > Pages > Sign up** and update the copy on the sign up page to cater for both the registration and sign in experience.
The result is:

- Users with an account will authenticate
- Users without an account will be registered
- Nobody will see a prompt to create an account

You can do this for any authentication method, e.g. email + password, email + OTP, phone + SMS OTP, social connection, or enterprise connection.

## Ask for first name and last name on sign up

By default, the Kinde sign up flow includes fields for users to enter their first name and last name. However, if you don’t want to collect user’s names, you can easily switch this off. This can make the sign up experience a bit faster, because when a user goes to sign up, all they need is their email, phone number, or their social sign in.

**To switch off the name requirement for sign up**

1. Go to **Settings > Applications > View details** on your application.
2. Scroll to the **Authentication experience** section.
3. Switch off **Ask for user first name and last name**.
4. Select **Save**.

## Request consent for marketing on sign up

If you want, you can add a checkbox to the sign up screen for collecting user consent to receive marketing communications.

See [Request user consent for marketing on sign up](/design/pages/marketing-consent/) for details.

## Pre-populate user identity for sign in

Create a smoother sign up and sign in experience for users by passing `login_hint` with the auth URL. This prefills the user’s sign in identity, saving them from manually entering their email or phone number. You might want to do this, for example, if you invite users to sign up via email and you want to reduce friction and make signing in faster.

See [Pre-populate user identity on sign in](/authenticate/custom-configurations/prepopulate-identity-sign-in/) for details.
