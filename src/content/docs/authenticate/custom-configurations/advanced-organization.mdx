> ⚡ Only businesses on the [Kinde Scale plan](https://kinde.com/pricing/) can enable advanced organization features. Additional fees apply.

When you enable advanced organizations features, you can access extended features for individual organizations. Customizations include:

- Set up [authentication methods per org](/authenticate/manage-authentication/organization-auth-experience/)
- Additional access control via [policies](
- Organization-level custom domains (coming soon)

## Enable advanced organization features

> ⚠️ Note: there is a monthly cost for each organization that is enabled to use advanced features.

1. In Kinde, go to **Organizations**.
2. Search or browse for the organization you want and select the name to show the org details.
3. Select **Authentication**.
4. In the **Activate advanced organization features** box, select **Activate**.

## Disable advanced organization features

> ⚠️ Note that when you disable advanced features, all advanced settings revert to global business settings. This could cause breaking changes in apps that rely on custom authentication for the organization. Your next bill will also be adjusted.

1. In Kinde, go to **Organizations**.
2. Search or browse for the organization you want and select the name to show the org details.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the **Details** page and select **Remove advanced org features**.
