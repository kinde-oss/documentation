> ⚡ This is an advanced feature that is only available on the [Kinde Scale plan](https://kinde.com/pricing/). Charges also apply for each organization that uses advanced org features.

You can set different authentication methods for each organization you manage in Kinde. You might want to do this if your customers are businesses that require unique auth setups.

## Before you begin

First, [set up each authentication method](/authenticate/authentication-methods/set-up-user-authentication/) you will use in your environment, and [enable the methods](/authenticate/manage-authentication/manage-authentication-applications/) in the relevant applications.

## Set custom authentication for an organization

> ⚠️ When you set custom authentication for an organization, it completely overrides the auth pattern set at the environment level. Nothing is inherited, except which methods are available to select for the organization.

1. In Kinde, go to **Organizations**.
2. Browse or search for the organization.
3. In the list, select the organization to open the details page.
4. Select **Authentication** in the menu.
5. Activate the advanced features for this org, if you haven’t already.
6. Switch on the **Apply custom authentication** option. All the available authentication methods you have set up in Kinde are shown.
7. Use the switches to enable and disable authentication methods for the organization.
8. When you’ve finished making changes, select **Save**.

## Edit or remove custom authentication for an organization

If you remove custom auth, your organizations will revert back to using the default auth set up.

> ⚠️ Switching off custom auth settings may cause authentication to fail when users try to sign in.

1. In Kinde, go to **Organizations**.
2. Browse or search to find the organization.
3. In the list, select the organization to open the details page.
4. Select **Authentication** in the menu.
5. If you want to edit the auth options, toggle them on or off.
6. If you want to remove the custom settings, switch off the **Apply custom authentication** option. Note that this can cause breaking changes if users are signing in with the auth settings for the organization.
7. Select **Save**.
