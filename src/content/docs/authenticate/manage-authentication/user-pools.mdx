    Comprehensive guide to Organization User Pools - a multi-tenant user management feature that isolates user identities within organizations for secure B2B environments.
---

Organization User Pools is a powerful multi-tenant user management feature that isolates user identities within specific organizations. This feature is essential for B2B applications where you need to maintain separate user pools across different client organizations while allowing the same email addresses or usernames to exist across organizations.

## What are Organization User Pools?

Organization User Pools create isolated user identity spaces within your Kinde environment. Each organization maintains its own pool of user identities, preventing cross-organization identity conflicts and ensuring data isolation.

### Key Benefits

- **Identity Isolation**: Users from different organizations cannot access each other's accounts
- **Email Reuse**: The same email address can exist across multiple organizations
- **Secure Multi-tenancy**: Complete data and identity separation between organizations
- **Scalable B2B**: Support unlimited organizations with isolated user management
- **Backward Compatibility**: Works with existing authentication flows

## Use Cases

### B2B SaaS Applications
- **Multi-tenant platforms** where each client organization has isolated users
- **Enterprise applications** requiring strict data separation
- **Partner portals** with organization-specific access

### Enterprise Organizations
- **Internal departments** with separate user management
- **Subsidiary companies** requiring isolated user pools
- **Client-specific deployments** with unique user spaces

### Example Scenario

Consider a project management SaaS serving multiple companies:

```
Company A (org_company_a):
- john.doe@companya.com
- jane.smith@companya.com

Company B (org_company_b):
- john.doe@companyb.com  (same email, different organization, different password)
- mike.wilson@companyb.com
```

Without Organization User Pools, the second `john.doe@companyb.com` would conflict with the first. With Organization User Pools enabled, both can coexist safely.

## How to Enable Organization User Pools

This is disabled by default. This can be enabled by updating the environment settings when the account has no users.

1. Visit "Settings > Environment Details" 
2. Click the "Enable Organization User Pools" toggle
3. Click "Save"
