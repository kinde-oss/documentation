  Complete guide to setting up Discord social sign-in with app creation, OAuth configuration, and Kinde integration.
---

You can enable users to sign up and sign in using their Discord credentials. To enable this, you’ll need a Discord app and some developer know-how.

<Aside type="warning" title="Social sign in for production environments">

Before you make your production environment live, you must add your own social app's Client ID and Client secret in the Kinde connection (as per below). Do not use Kinde's app credentials by leaving the fields blank, as this poses a security and performance risk, and makes it difficult to change auth providers without service disruptions for your users.

</Aside>

## **Get your Kinde callback URL**

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings** > **Authentication**.
2. In the **Social connections** section, select **Add connection.**
3. In the window that appears, select **Discord,** then select **Next**.
4. In the **Callback URL** section:
   1. If you use Kinde’s domain as your default, copy the **Kinde domain** URL.
   2. If you use custom domains, select the Use custom domain instead switch.
   3. If you have only one custom domain, copy the Custom domain URL. If you have custom domains for multiple organizations, select each one from the list and copy the callbacks for each. You need to enter all custom domain callbacks in the Discord app.
5. Select **Save**.
6. Use the copied Callback URL to set up the app, see below.

## Create and configure a Discord app

1. Log in to the [Discord developer site](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) and create a new app.
2. Give it a name and then go to **OAuth2** in the side menu.
3. In **OAuth2 > General**, copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret** somewhere you can access it later. If the client secret is not showing, select **Reset Secret**.
4. Paste in the **Callback URLs** (the ones you copied above), e.g. `https://yourdomain.kinde.com/login/callback`. Add entries for all your organization custom domain callbacks, e.g. `account.customdomainone.com/login/callback`, `account.customdomaintwo.com/login/callback`, etc.
5. Save your changes.

## **Add Discord credentials to Kinde**

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings** > **Authentication**.
2. On the **Discord** tile, select **Configure**.
3. Paste the **Client ID** and **Client secret** from the Discord app into the relevant fields.
4. Select if you want to treat this connection as a trusted provider. A [trusted provider](/authenticate/about-auth/identity-and-verification/) is one that guarantees the email they issue is verified. We recommend leaving this off for maximum security.
5. Add any [upstream params](/authenticate/auth-guides/pass-params-idp/) that you want to pass to the IdP.
6. Select which applications will allow Discord social sign in.
7. Select **Save**.

Users will now see Discord as an option to sign up and sign in to the selected applications.
