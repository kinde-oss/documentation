You can enable users to sign up and sign in using their LinkedIn credentials. To enable this, you’ll need a LinkedIn app and some developer know-how.

## **Get the Kinde Callback URL**

1. Sign in to Kinde.
2. Go to the **Settings** page and select **Authentication**.
3. In the **Social connections** section, select **Add connection.**
4. In the window that opens, select **LinkedIn**, then select **Save**.
5. On the LinkedIn tile, select the **Configure** link.
6. In the **Callback URL** section:
   1. If you use Kinde’s domain as your default, copy the **Kinde domain** URL.
   2. If you use custom domains, select the Use custom domain instead switch.
   3. If you have only one custom domain, copy the Custom domain URL. If you have custom domains for multiple organizations, select each one from the list and copy the callbacks for each. You need to enter all custom domain callbacks in the LinkedIn app.
7. Use the copied Callback URLs to set up the app, see below.

## **Create a LinkedIn app and set up**

1. Go to the [LinkedIn developer space](https://developer.linkedin.com/) and select **Create app**.
2. Complete the details, including name, logo, company LinkedIn page, privacy policy link, etc.
3. Select **Create app**.
4. In the **Products** tab, select **Request access** on the **Sign in with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect** tile.
5. In the dialog that opens, agree to the terms and conditions to continue. You can now view the endpoints.

## **Configure your LinkedIn app**

1. Go to the **Auth** tab.
2. In the **Auth 2.0 settings** area, select the edit icon next to the **Authorized redirect URLs for your app.**
3. Paste the **Callback URLs** you copied from Kinde in the first procedure. Add entries for all your organization custom domain callbacks, e.g. account.customdomainone.com/login/callback, account.customdomaintwo.com/login/callback, etc.
4. In the same tab, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and paste them in a text file or somewhere you can easily copy them.

For additional help, see the [LinkedIn docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/linkedin/consumer/integrations/self-serve/sign-in-with-linkedin).

## **Add LinkedIn credentials to Kinde**

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings** > **Authentication**.
2. On the **LinkedIn** tile, select **Configure**.
3. Paste the **Client ID** and **Client secret** from the LinkedIn app into the relevant fields.
4. Select if you want to treat this connection as a trusted provider. A [trusted provider](/authenticate/about-auth/identity-and-verification/) is one that guarantees the email they issue is verified. We recommend leaving this off for maximum security.
5. Select which applications will allow LinkedIn SSO.
6. Select **Save**.

Users will now see LinkedIn as an option to sign up and sign in to the selected applications.
