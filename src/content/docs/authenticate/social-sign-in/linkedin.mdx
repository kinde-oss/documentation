You can enable users to sign up and sign in using their LinkedIn credentials. To enable this, you’ll need a LinkedIn app and some developer know-how.

## **Get the Kinde Callback URL**

1. Sign in to Kinde.
2. Go to the **Settings** page and select **Authentication**.
3. In the **Social connections** section, select **Add connection.**
4. In the window that opens, select **LinkedIn**, then select **Save**.
5. On the LinkedIn tile, select the **Configure** link.
6. In the **Callback URL** section:
   1. If you use Kinde’s domain as your default, copy the **Kinde domain** URL.
   2. If you use a custom domain (and want to use it as the callback) select the **Use custom domain instead** switch and copy the **Custom domain** URL.
7. Use the copied Callback URL to set up the app, see below.

## **Create a LinkedIn app and set up**

1. Go to the [LinkedIn developer space](https://developer.linkedin.com/) and select **Create app**.
2. Complete the details, including name, logo, company LinkedIn page, privacy policy link, etc.
3. Select **Create app**.
4. In the **Products** tab, select **Request access** on the **Sign in with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect** tile.
5. In the dialog that opens, agree to the terms and conditions to continue. You can now view the endpoints.

## **Configure your LinkedIn app**

1. Go to the **Auth** tab.
2. In the **Auth 2.0 settings** area, select the edit icon next to the **Authorized redirect URLs for your app.**
3. Paste the **Callback URL** you copied from Kinde in the first procedure.
4. In the same tab, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and paste them in a text file or somewhere you can easily copy them.

For additional help, see the [LinkedIn docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/linkedin/consumer/integrations/self-serve/sign-in-with-linkedin).

## **Add LinkedIn credentials to Kinde**

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings** > **Authentication**.
2. On the **LinkedIn** tile, select **Configure**.
3. Paste the **Client ID** and **Client secret** from the LinkedIn app into the relevant fields.
4. Select if you want to treat this connection as a trusted provider. A [trusted provider](/authenticate/about-auth/identity-and-verification/) is one that guarantees the email they issue is verified. We recommend leaving this off for maximum security. 
5. Select which applications will allow LinkedIn SSO.
6. Select **Save**.

Users will now see LinkedIn as an option to sign up and sign in to the selected applications.
