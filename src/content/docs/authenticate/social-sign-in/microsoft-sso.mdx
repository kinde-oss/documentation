You can enable users to sign up and sign in using their Microsoft credentials. To enable this, you’ll need a Microsoft Azure account and some developer know-how.

## **Get the Kinde Callback URL**

1. Sign in to Kinde.
2. Go to the **Settings** page and select **Authentication**.
3. In the **Social connections** section, select **Add connection.**
4. In the window that opens, select Microsoft, then select **Save**.
5. On the Microsoft tile, select the **Configure** link.
6. In the **Callback URL** section:
   1. If you use Kinde’s domain as your default, copy the **Kinde domain** URL.
   2. If you use a custom domain (and want to use it as the callback) select the **Use custom domain instead** switch and copy the **Custom domain** URL.
7. Use the copied Callback URL to set up the app, see below.

## Register a Microsoft app and set up

1. Go to your account at [https://portal.azure.com/](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory**. You can do this from links on the main screen or in the left side menu.
3. Select **Add+ > App registration**.
4. Enter a name for the app.
5. Select a **Supported account types option**. In testing, we selected **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts**.
6. In the **Redirect URI (optional)** section, select your app type in the **Select a platform** dropdown.
7. Enter the **Callback URL** from Kinde. The one you copied in the procedure above.
8. Select **Register**. Details of your new app appear.
9. Copy the **Application (client) ID** and paste it in a text file or somewhere you can easily access it again.
10. Select **Certificates and secrets** from the left menu, select + **New client secret.**
11. Enter a name and give it an expiry date (or accept the default), then select **Add**. Details of the secret are generated.
12. Copy the value in the **Value** column and paste it in a text file or somewhere you can easily access it again. Make sure you copy from the **Value** column, not the **Secret ID** column.

## Add Microsoft app credentials to Kinde

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings** > **Authentication**.
2. In the **Social connections** section, select **Add connection.**
3. In the window that appears, select **Microsoft,** then select **Save**. Microsoft now appears in the **Social connections** list.
4. On the **Microsoft** tile, select **Configure**.
5. Paste the **Client ID** (Application (client) ID) and **Client secret value** (that you copied from the **Value** column at step 12 above) into the relevant fields.
6. Select if you want to treat this connection as a trusted provider. A [trusted provider](/authenticate/about-auth/identity-and-verification/) is one that guarantees the email they issue is verified. We recommend leaving this off for maximum security. 
7. Select which applications will allow Microsoft SSO.
8. Select **Save**.

Users will now see Microsoft as an option to sign up and sign in to the selected applications.
