You can enable users to sign up and sign in using their Microsoft credentials. To enable this, you’ll need a Microsoft Azure account and some developer know-how.

## **Get the Kinde Callback URL**

1. Sign in to Kinde.
2. Go to the **Settings** page and select **Authentication**.
3. In the **Social connections** section, select **Add connection.**
4. In the window that opens, select Microsoft, then select **Save**.
5. On the Microsoft tile, select the **Configure** link.
6. In the **Callback URL** section:
   1. If you use Kinde’s domain as your default, copy the **Kinde domain** URL.
   2. If you use custom domains, select the **Use custom domain instead** switch.
   3. If you have only one custom domain, copy the Custom domain URL. If you have custom domains for multiple organizations, select each one from the list and copy the callbacks for each. You need to enter all custom domain callbacks in the Microsoft app.
7. Use the copied Callback URL to set up the app, see below.

## Register a Microsoft app and set up

1. Go to your account at [https://portal.azure.com/](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory**. You can do this from links on the main screen or in the left side menu.
3. Select **Add+ > App registration**.
4. Enter a name for the app.
5. Select a **Supported account types option**. In testing, we selected **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts**.
6. In the **Redirect URI (optional)** section, select your app type in the **Select a platform** dropdown.
7. Enter the **Callback URL** from Kinde. The ones you copied in the procedure above. Add additional entries for all your organization custom domain callbacks, e.g. account.customdomainone.com/login/callback, account.customdomaintwo.com/login/callback, etc.
8. Select **Register**. Details of your new app appear.
9. Copy the **Application (client) ID** and paste it in a text file or somewhere you can easily access it again.
10. Select **Certificates and secrets** from the left menu, select + **New client secret.**
11. Enter a name and give it an expiry date (or accept the default), then select **Add**. Details of the secret are generated.
12. Copy the value in the **Value** column and paste it in a text file or somewhere you can easily access it again. Make sure you copy from the **Value** column, not the **Secret ID** column.

## Add Microsoft app credentials to Kinde

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings** > **Authentication**.
2. In the **Social connections** section, select **Add connection.**
3. In the window that appears, select **Microsoft,** then select **Save**. Microsoft now appears in the **Social connections** list.
4. On the **Microsoft** tile, select **Configure**.
5. Paste the **Client ID** (Application (client) ID) and **Client secret value** (that you copied from the **Value** column at step 12 above) into the relevant fields.
6. Select if you want to treat this connection as a trusted provider. A [trusted provider](/authenticate/about-auth/identity-and-verification/) is one that guarantees the email they issue is verified. We recommend leaving this off for maximum security.
7. Select which applications will allow Microsoft SSO.
8. Select **Save**.

Users will now see Microsoft as an option to sign up and sign in to the selected applications.
