  Complete guide to setting up Twitch social sign-in with app registration, OAuth configuration, and Kinde integration.
---

You can enable users to sign up and sign in using their Twitch credentials. To enable this, you’ll need a Twitch account and some developer know-how.

<Aside type="warning" title="Social sign in for production environments">

Before you make your production environment live, you must add your own social app's Client ID and Client secret in the Kinde connection (as per below). Do not use Kinde's app credentials by leaving the fields blank, as this poses a security and performance risk, and makes it difficult to change auth providers without service disruptions for your users.

</Aside>

## **Before you begin**

**Enable Twitch 2FA** — Sign up for a Twitch account and [enable two-factor authentication](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/two-factor-authentication?language=en_US) (2FA). You will need your mobile number and an authenticator app e.g. Google authenticator, to do this.

## **Get the Kinde callback URL**

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings** > **Authentication**.
2. In the **Social authentication** section, select **Add connection.**
3. Select **Twitch** and then select **Next.**
4. In the **Callback URL** section:
   1. If you use Kinde’s domain as your default, copy the **Kinde domain** URL.
   2. If you use custom domains, select the **Use custom domain instead** option.
   3. If you have only one custom domain, copy the Custom domain URL. If you have custom domains for multiple organizations, select each one from the list and copy the callbacks for each. You need to enter all custom domain callbacks in the Twitch app.
5. Select **Save**.
6. Use the copied Callback URLs to set up the app, see below.

## **Register a Twitch app**

1. Go to the [Twitch developer console](https://dev.twitch.tv/) and select **Applications**.
2. Select **Register your application**.
3. Enter a name and the Kinde callback URLs you copied above. Add entries for all your organization custom domain callbacks, e.g. `account.customdomainone.com/login/callback`, `account.customdomaintwo.com/login/callback`, etc.
4. Select the **Category** as an **Application Integration**.
5. Select **Create**.

See the [Twitch docs](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/register-app#registering-your-app) for additional help.

## **Get app Client ID and Client secret**

1. In the **Application** section in Twitch, select **Manage** next to your application.
2. Copy the **Client ID.**
3. Select **New secret** and when prompted, confirm.
4. Copy and paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into a text file or somewhere you can easily copy them.

## **Add Twitch credentials to Kinde**

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings** > **Authentication**.
2. On the Twitch tile, select **Configure**.
3. Paste the **Client ID** and **Client secret** from the app into the relevant fields.
4. Select if you want to treat this connection as a trusted provider. A [trusted provider](/authenticate/about-auth/identity-and-verification/) is one that guarantees the email they issue is verified. We recommend leaving this off for maximum security.
5. Add any [upstream params](/authenticate/auth-guides/pass-params-idp/) that you want to pass to the IdP.
6. Select which applications will allow Twitch SSO.
7. Select **Save**.

Users will now see Twitch as an option to sign up and sign in to the selected applications.

## When an email is not provided

Twitch does not require an email for sign up, but Kinde does. So if a user signs up with Twitch and an email is not detected, we will ask for one.

The user only needs to provide their email once, then they can sign in via Twitch without disruption.

If the email they provide is already detected in Kinde, we will automatically link the accounts so as not to duplicate.
