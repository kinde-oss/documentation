In this guide, we'll explain IdP-initiated SSO and how to configure it in your Kinde account.

## What is IdP-initiated SSO?

IdP-initiated SSO is an authentication flow where the login process **starts at the Identity Provider** rather than at your application (the Service Provider).

When setting up enterprise authentication, you'll encounter two main ways to start a SAML single sign-on flow: Service Provider (SP) initiated and Identity Provider (IdP) initiated. This differs from SP-initiated SSO, where the user first visits your application and is then redirected to the IdP to authenticate.

### How it works

1. A user logs into their corporate Identity Provider portal (such as Okta, Azure AD, or Google Workspace)
2. From the IdP dashboard, the user clicks on your application
3. The IdP creates a SAML assertion containing the user's identity and attributes
4. The IdP sends this assertion directly to your Kinde ACS URL
5. Kinde validates the assertion and creates a user session
6. The user is redirected to your application

### What you need 


- A [Kinde](https://kinde.com) account with an **enterprise connections** entitlement
- Admin access to your [enterprise identity Provider](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/about-enterprise-connections) (Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, etc.)
- A [verified domain](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/about-enterprise-connections#domain-based-access-control) configured in Kinde (for organization-level connections)

---

## Step 1: Add a SAML enterprise connection in Kinde

### Option A: Environment-level connection (shared across organizations)

1. Sign in to your Kinde admin portal
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Authentication**
3. Click **Add connection** in the Enterprise connections section
4. Select your SAML provider:
   - **Custom SAML** (for any SAML 2.0 IdP)
   - **Google Workspace** (pre-configured for Google)
   - **Okta** (pre-configured for Okta)
   - **Cloudflare** (pre-configured for Cloudflare Access)
5. Click **Save** to create the connection

### Option B: Organization-level connection (specific to one organization)

1. Sign in to your Kinde admin portal
2. Navigate to **Organizations** > select your organization
3. Go to the **Authentication** tab
4. Click **Add SSO connection**
5. Choose your connection type (SAML, Entra ID, etc.)
6. Select the **domains** that can authenticate via this connection
7. Click **Save**

<Aside type="warning">

Organization-level connections require verified domains to be configured for the organization first. Contact your system administrator if no domains are available.

</Aside>


## Step 2: Configure the SAML connection details

After creating the connection, configure these settings:

### Required settings

| Field | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Connection name** | A name to identify this connection | "Acme Corp SSO" |
| **Entity ID** | The unique identifier configured in your IdP | `https://yourapp.kinde.com` |
| **IdP metadata URL** | The SAML metadata URL from your Identity Provider | `https://idp.example.com/metadata.xml` |

### Values to copy to your IdP

These values are generated by Kinde and need to be added to your Identity Provider:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL** | The URL where your IdP sends SAML responses. Also called "Reply URL" |
| **Logout URL** | URL for SAML logout responses (if using Single Logout) |

Copy these values from the Kinde connection configuration screen


## Step 3: Configure attribute mapping

Map SAML attributes from your IdP to Kinde user properties:

| Kinde field | Default SAML attribute | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Email** | `email` | User's email address |
| **User ID** | `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier` | Unique user identifier |
| **First name** | `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/givenname` | User's first name |
| **Last name** | `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/surname` | User's last name |

    <Aside>

    If your IdP uses different attribute names, enter the correct attribute keys in the mapping fields.

    </Aside>

## Step 4: Configure your Identity Provider

In your IdP admin console, create a new SAML application with these settings:

### Required IdP configuration

1. **ACS URL / Reply URL**

   ```
   https://yourdomain.kinde.com/login/saml/callback
   ```

2. **Entity ID / Audience**

   Use the Entity ID you configured in Kinde

3. **Name ID format**

   Choose one of:

   - `Persistent` (recommended)
   - `Email address`
   - `Transient`
   - `Unspecified`

### For IdP-initiated SSO specifically

1. **RelayState** (optional)

   Configure a default RelayState URL if your IdP supports it. This is where users are redirected after authentication.

2. **Enable IdP-initiated SSO**

   In your IdP's application settings, enable the option to allow IdP-initiated sign-on (the exact setting name varies by provider)


## Step 5: Configure advanced settings (optional)

### Home realm discovery

Configure domains for automatic connection routing:

1. In the connection settings, find **Home realm domains**
2. Add domains (one per line) that should use this connection

   ```
   acmecorp.com
   acme.co
   ```

3. When users enter an email matching these domains, they'll be automatically routed to this SSO connection

### Always show sign-in button

- **Off (default):** If home realm domains are set, the SSO button only shows after email domain detection
- **On:** The SSO button is always visible on the login screen

### Single logout

Enable users to be logged out of the IdP when they log out of your app:

1. Toggle **Enable single logout**
2. Enter the **Single logout endpoint URL** from your IdP
3. Copy the **Logout URL** from Kinde to your IdP configuration

### Sign SAML requests

For enhanced security, configure signed SAML requests:

1. Upload your **Signing certificate** (PEM format)
2. Upload your **Private key** (PEM format)
3. Select the **Sign request algorithm** (RSA-SHA1 or RSA-SHA256)

## Step 6: Configure user provisioning

Control how users are created when authenticating via SAML:

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Create a user record in Kinde** | When enabled, users who don't exist in Kinde are automatically created on first sign-in |
| **Auto-add users** (org-level only) | Users are automatically added as members of the organization |
| **Trust email addresses** | Merge accounts when email matches an existing Kinde user |

## Step 7: Enable the connection

### For environment-level connections

1. Navigate to **Applications** > select your application
2. Go to the **Authentication** tab
3. Enable your SAML connection in the **Enterprise connections** section

### For organization-level connections

1. In the connection settings, toggle **Enable for organization**
2. Users in this organization can now use this connection

## Testing the configuration

### Test SP-initiated flow (standard)

1. Navigate to your application's login page
2. Enter an email address matching a home realm domain
3. You should be redirected to your IdP
4. After authentication, you should be redirected back to your app

### Test IdP-initiated flow

1. Log in to your Identity Provider's portal
2. Click on your application in the IdP dashboard
3. You should be redirected to your app and logged in automatically

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

| Issue | Possible cause | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "Invalid SAML response" | Mismatched Entity ID | Ensure the Entity ID in Kinde matches your IdP configuration exactly |
| "Signature verification failed" | Certificate mismatch | Verify your IdP's signing certificate is correctly configured |
| User not created | Provisioning disabled | Enable "Create a user record in Kinde" |
| Wrong attributes | Attribute mapping | Check that your IdP attribute names match the mapped keys |

## Security best practices

1. **Prefer SP-initiated when possible**

   SP-initiated SSO includes additional security validations (InResponseTo, state/nonce)

2. **Enable IdP-initiated only when required**

   Only enable for enterprise customers who specifically require portal-based access

3. **Use signed requests**

   Configure SAML request signing for enhanced security

4. **Enforce MFA at the IdP**

   Since authentication happens at the IdP, ensure MFA is required there

5. **Keep certificates current**

   Monitor certificate expiration and rotate before they expire

Note: IdP-initiated SAML SSO support may vary by Identity Provider. Contact Kinde support if you encounter issues with specific IdP configurations.
