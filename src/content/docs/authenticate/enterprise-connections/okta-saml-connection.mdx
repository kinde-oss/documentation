If you use Okta to centralize authentication and authorization in your business, you can integrate Kinde as a service provider for these processes. This gives you the benefits of Kinde’s robust auth capabilities, while keeping the familiar Okta structure.

You need to set up an enterprise connection in Kinde for this, and add an Okta application. See steps below.

## Advanced configurations

Depending on your SAML set up, you may need to include advanced configurations for your connection. See [Advanced SAML configurations](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/advanced-saml-configurations/).

## Step 1: Add an Okta connection in Kinde

### Add a connection for a specific organization

1. Go to **Organizations** and open the organization. 
2. In the menu, select **Authentication**, then select **Add connection**.
3. In the **Add connection** window, select **New enterprise connection**, then click **Next**.
4. Select the Okta connection and then select **Next**. 
5. Next: 'Step 2: Configure the connection'.

### Add a connection that can be shared across multiple organizations

1. Go to **Settings > Environment > Authentication**.
2. Scroll to the **Enterprise connection** section and select **Add connection**. The **Add connection** window opens.
3. Select the Okta connection and then select **Save**.
4. On the tile for the new connection, select **Configure**.
5. Next: 'Step 2: Configure the connection'.

## Step 2: Configure the connection

1. Enter a name for the connection.
2. Enter a random value for the **Entity ID**, e.g. `870sa9fbasfasdas23aghkhc12zasfnasd`.

3. Enter the **IdP metadata URL**. This URL comes from your identity provider. If you haven't set up your app yet, you can add this later. 

   ![optional fields for saml](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/4f1851db-5c34-496b-ced1-07c1cd272b00/public)

4. Enter a **sign in URL** if your IdP requires a specific URL.
5. If you want, select the **Sign request algorithm** and **Protocol binding**. The options you choose will depend on what your identity provider prefers or requires.
6. Select a **Name ID** format. This helps identify and link user identities between your IdP and Kinde. 
7. Enter an **Email key attribute**. This is the attribute in the SAML token that contains the user’s email. Setting this value ensures that the email address returned in the SAML response is correctly retrieved. We do not recommend leaving this field blank, but if you do we will set ‘email’ as the attribute.
8. (Optional) Add a first name and last name key attribute.

9. Enter any relevant **Home realm domains**. This is how SAML recognizes a user’s credentials and routes them to the correct sign in page. Note that home realm domains need to be unique across all connections in an environment. [Read more about home realm domains](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/home-realm-discovery/).
10. If you use home realm domains, the sign in button is hidden on the auth screen by default. To show the SSO button, select the **Always show sign-in button** option.

11. Copy the relevant reply URL: 
    1. If you don't use a custom domain, copy the **ACS URL**.
    2. If you do use a custom domain, select the **Use custom domain instead** option and copy the custom domain URL. 
    Later, add this URL to your identity provider configuration.
12. If you want to enable just-in-time (JIT) provisioning for users, select the **Create a user record in Kinde** option. This saves time adding users manually or via API later.

13. Select **Trust email addresses provided by this connection** if you want to treat this connection as a [trusted provider](/authenticate/about-auth/identity-and-verification/#trusting-emails-from-providers).

    <Aside type="warning">

    This option should be disabled unless you understand the impact of having this enabled as some providers do not verify email addresses. We recommend leaving this off for maximum security.

    </Aside>
14. (Optional) In the **Sign SAML request** section, paste in the **Signed certificate** and **Private key**. You may have got these from your IdP or you may have generated yourself (see procedure above).
15. Enter any [upstream params](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/advanced-saml-configurations/#upstream-parameters) that you want to pass to the identity provider. Not all providers support this, so check their documentation first.
16. Select **Save**.

## Step 3: Add and configure your Okta application

1. Sign in to the Okta admin console.
2. Select **Applications > Applications**.

   ![Okta config window](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/63dee3f1-b0ba-4961-33e9-a8f928a07d00/public)
  
3. Select **Create App Integration**. The **Sign-in method** options opens.
4. Select SAML 2.0 and then select **Next**. The app’s general settings opens.

5. Add a name in the **App name** field then select **Next**. The **Configure SAML** screen opens.

6. In the **SAML settings** section, enter the following values:
   1. **Single sign-on URL:** Paste the **Assertion Customer Service (ACS) URL** you copied from Kinde.
   2. **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)**: Paste the **Entity ID** you copied from Kinde.
   3. **Name ID format:** Select **EmailAddress**.
   4. **Application username**: Select **Email**.
   5. Leave all other options to their default value and select **Next**.
7. Select **Finish**. You will be redirected to the newly created application in Okta.
8. Select the **Sign on** tab and copy the metadata URL.

   ![Metadata URL in Okta](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/9bdcb215-054e-45c1-11a7-2df2f4be7800/public)
 
## Step 4: Finish setting up your SAML connection in Kinde

1. Open the connection in Kinde. Via Organization > Authentication or via Settings > Authentication.
2. Scroll to the **IdP metadata URL** field and paste the **Metadata URL** you copied from Okta.
3. Enter the signed certificate and key information if you have it. You can do this later as well. 
4. Switch on the connection. This will make it instantly available to users if this is your production environment.
   1. For environment-level connections, scroll down and select the apps that will use the auth method.
   2. For organization-level connections, scroll down and select if you want to switch this on for the org. 
5. Select **Save**. You can now use Okta as an IdP for the selected applications.

## Troubleshooting the connection

If you get an error in Okta that says **User is not assigned to this application**, it means you need to assign a user or group to your Okta application.

1. Go to the **Applications** section in your Okta Admin Console.
2. Select the SAML 2.0 app you set up.
3. Under the **Assignments** tab, click **Assign > Assign to People or Assign to Groups**.
4. Choose the user or group you want to assign to this application and save your changes.
