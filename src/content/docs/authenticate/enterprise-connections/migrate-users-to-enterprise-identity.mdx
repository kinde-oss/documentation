---

This guide walks you through migrating existing email/password users to Enterprise SSO connections (such as SAML or Entra ID). This process uses just-in-time (JIT) provisioning to map existing users to their enterprise identities based on matching email addresses.


### What you need

- A [Kinde](https://kinde.com) account with existing users.
- An enterprise app connected in Kinde, see the list of [enterprise connections](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/about-enterprise-connections/) for more information.
- Users with email addresses that match exactly their Enterprise Identity (capitalization and structure must match)
- A test application in Kinde.

## Test the integration with Kinde

Before testing with real users, verify the connection works correctly with a single test user. This helps identify any configuration issues early.

### Enable the connection for your test application

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Authentication**.
2. Find your Enterprise Connection and select **Configure**.
3. Scroll down to the **Applications** section.
4. Toggle the connection **ON** for your test application. Ideally, this should be an application that is not publicly available.
5. Select **Save**.

### Prepare a test user

1. Identify one existing Kinde user who has an email/password identity.
2. Verify that this user's email address in Kinde **exactly matches** their email address in Entra ID (capitalization and structure must be identical).
3. Ensure this test user has access to your test application.
4. Confirm you can access Entra ID sign-in logs and Kinde logs for verification purposes.

### Test the SSO flow

1. Open your test application in an incognito/private browser window.
2. Initiate the SSO login flow:
   - If you configured home realm domains, enter the test user's email address and select **Continue**. You should be redirected to Entra ID.
   - If you didn't configure home realm domains, select the **Sign in with Enterprise** or **SSO** button.
3. Authenticate with the test user's Entra ID credentials.
4. After successful authentication, Entra ID should redirect back to Kinde (via the ACS URL).
5. Kinde should process the SAML response and either:
   - Map to the existing Kinde user (if the email matches and **Trust email addresses** is enabled), preserving the user's profile, roles, and permissions; **or**
   - Create a new Kinde user via JIT provisioning with the SAML attributes if no match exists.
6. You should be redirected back to your application with a valid authenticated session.

### Verify the test was successful

Check the following to confirm everything worked correctly:

**In your enterprise app:**
   - Go to **Sign-in logs** and verify the authentication attempt appears.
   - Confirm the SAML response was sent successfully to Kinde.

**In Kinde:**
   - Go to **Users** and find your test user.
   - Verify the user's profile information (name, email) was preserved.
   - Check that roles and permissions are intact (if applicable).
   - Review the user's identity - it should now show the Enterprise Connection identity instead of email/password.

**In your application:**
   - Confirm the user can access protected resources.
   - Verify the session/token is valid.
   - Test that the user's profile data is correctly displayed.

**Test email/password login (optional):**
   - Attempt to sign in with the test user's email/password credentials.
   - If home realm discovery is configured, you should be redirected to the Microsoft login page instead of the email/password form.

### Troubleshooting

If the test doesn't work:

- **Disable the Enterprise Connection** in Kinde to prevent further issues.
- **Collect debug information:**
   - Check Entra ID sign-in logs for error messages.
   - Review Kinde logs for SAML processing errors.
   - Verify the ACS URL in Entra ID matches the one in Kinde.
   - Confirm the Entity ID matches in both systems.
- **Email address format mismatches:** Different identity providers may return email addresses in different formats, which can prevent successful user mapping:
   - Ensure email addresses match exactly (case-sensitive) between Kinde and your IdP.
   - Verify the **Email key attribute** matches the exact attribute name your IdP uses (e.g., `emailaddress`, `emailAddress`, `email`, or full claim URIs).
   - Check your IdP's SAML response to confirm the exact email format being sent.
- **Revert the test user** back to email/password identity if needed.
- **Fix any configuration issues** and repeat the test.

## Pilot roll-out

Once you've successfully tested with a single user, expand testing to a small group of representative users:

- Select several test users from different departments or teams.
- Test across different browser configurations (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- Have each test user complete the SSO login flow.
- Monitor both Kinde and Entra ID logs for any errors or mapping problems.
- Verify each user's profile, roles, and permissions are preserved correctly.
- Document any issues encountered and resolve them before proceeding to full migration.

### Enable the connection for live applications

After successful pilot testing, enable the Enterprise Connection for your production applications:

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Environment > Authentication**.
2. Find your Enterprise Connection and select **Configure**.
3. Scroll down to the **Applications** section.
4. Toggle the connection **ON** for each production application that should use this Enterprise Connection.
5. Select **Save**.

### Complete migration and disable trust email

Once all existing users for that Enterprise Connection have signed in successfully at least once:

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Environment > Authentication**.
2. Find your Enterprise Connection and select **Configure**.
3. Scroll down to the **Trust email addresses provided by this connection** option.
4. Turn this setting **OFF** (improves security and prevents silent linking of emails).
5. Select **Save**.

<Aside type="warning" title="Important">

Only disable **Trust email addresses** after all users have successfully migrated. Disabling this before migration is complete may prevent users from being mapped to their existing accounts.

</Aside>

## Post-migration checks and housekeeping

### After completing the migration:

**Audit logs:**
   - Review Kinde logs for any unknown or failed sign-ins.
   - Check Entra ID sign-in logs for authentication issues.
   - Verify all expected users have successfully migrated.

**Security:**
   - Revoke or rotate any signing certificates if needed per your security policy.
   - Confirm that email/password login is disabled for migrated accounts (if desired).

**User verification:**
   - Spot-check user profiles to ensure data integrity.
   - Verify roles and permissions are correctly maintained.

### Expected outcome (success criteria & what to look for)

**Primary success criteria:**

- User can initiate SSO login from the application and is redirected to Entra ID.
- Entra ID accepts credentials and returns a successful SAML response to Kinde (redirect to ACS URL).
- Kinde either:
    - Maps the incoming SAML `emailaddress` to the **existing** Kinde user (when `Trust email` is ON), preserving profile and permissions; **or**
    - Creates a new Kinde user via JIT provisioning with the SAML attributes if no match exists.
- The user is redirected back to the application with a valid authenticated session and can access resources according to their preserved permissions.
- Entra ID sign-in logs show the successful authentication; Kinde logs show either the mapped existing user sign-in or creation of the user from the Entra connection.
- After migration completion and verification, `Trust email addresses` can be turned **OFF** and email/password login disabled for migrated accounts.

### Items to be aware of

#### Identity removal

At the moment when a user has been given an Enterprise Connection identity, their existing identity is removed from their profile at the same time.

#### Email capitalization issue

We have noticed that users (using email or an Enterprise Connection) created before March 2025 will have an issue where their email address in the Enterprise Connection are capitalized and therefore not synced with existing profiles. They will need to be recreated with the email address having the exact same capitilisation as shown in Entra. You will need to delete the user and let them log in via their enterprise SSO, which will automatically create their enterprise identity.

#### Customer IdP setup

Your customers' IdP setups will be different from each other, we would recommend:

1. Organising a time with them to agree to when the change will happen
2. Flag with Kinde when this will happen, so we can be on hand to help
3. Be on a call with them at the point of change to ensure they can authenticate in.

Doing this will mean that when there are nuances between IdP setups, they can be identified and addressed swiftly. 

We would recommend, starting with a customer with a smaller user base first.

### Congratulations!

You have successfully migrated your users from email/password authentication to Enterprise Identity using SSO connections like SAML or Entra ID.

By leveraging just-in-time (JIT) provisioning and email address matching, you've seamlessly transitioned your users to enterprise authentication while preserving their profiles, roles, and permissions. This migration enhances security, simplifies user management, and provides a foundation for scaling your authentication infrastructure. Your users can now enjoy a streamlined SSO experience while maintaining access to all their existing resources.
