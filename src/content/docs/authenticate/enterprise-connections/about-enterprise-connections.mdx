Enterprise authentication is a common method for managing user access to systems in large organizations.

Kinde supports a number of enterprise connection types, including:

- [Custom SAML](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/custom-saml/)
- [Microsoft Entra ID](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/azure/) (was Azure AD) WS Federated or Open ID
- [Google workspace](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/custom-saml-google-workspace/) (via SAML)
- [Okta](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/okta-saml-connection/) (via SAML)
- [Cloudflare](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/cloudflare-saml/) (via SAML)

<Aside type="upgrade">

The number of enterprise connections you can have depends on your [Kinde plan](https://kinde.com/pricing/).

## Provisioning for enterprise connections

Kinde offer a number of provisioning options for enterprise connections, including **just in time (JIT)** provisioning and **pre-provisioning** options. 

See [Provisioning users with enterprise connections](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/provision-users-enterprise/)

## Enterprise connections for B2B businesses

Many businesses have businesses for customers (B2B), and use Kinde organizations to manage authentication and access. Kinde lets you set a number of enterprise authentication features at the organization level, see [Enterprise authentication for B2B](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/enterprise-connections-b2b/).

## Routing in enterprise connections

When users sign up via an enterprise connection with single-sign-on (SSO), they are routed to the identity provider (IdP) for identity verification. Here’s how this happens.

### The sign in button on the auth page

When you set up an enterprise connection in Kinde, the SSO button on the authentication page gets linked to the IdP by default, similar to how you see a Google or Facebook sign-in option. 

This is fine if you only have one connection, but is not ideal if you have multiple connections and you don’t want to show multiple SSO buttons to all users.

To avoid this, you can use home realm discovery (below). 

### Home realm discovery

Home realm discovery routes users based on their email domain. So when a users enter their email and selects the SSO button, they are routed to their IdP based on the email domain, to authenticate. For example if the user enters [chris@acme.com](mailto:chris@acme.com) Kinde checks which IdP uses the [**acme.com**](http://acme.com/) domain and sends Chris there to authenticate.

Note that this feature has nothing to do with security or access control and everything to do with routing. Do not confuse this feature with access restrictions for [domain allowlists](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/enterprise-connections-b2b/#restrict-org-access-via-connections).
