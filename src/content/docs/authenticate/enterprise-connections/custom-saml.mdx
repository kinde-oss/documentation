In Kinde, you can use SAML as your authentication protocol. Kinde acts as a service provider (SP), so you still need to bring your own identity provider (IdP) to set it up. Identity providers can include Google, Microsoft, Cloudflare, and others.

Note: Since there are differences between set ups for each IdP, we are unable to provide full details on how to configure them all to connect with Kinde. However, the fields we mention below, should have similar names in your IdP. Some concepts are explained in the [advanced SAML configurations](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/advanced-saml-configurations/) topic.

## User provisioning

Before you set up SAML, you can [import users in bulk](/manage-users/add-and-edit/import-users-in-bulk/), add them via [API](/kinde-apis/management#tag/users/post/api/v1/user), or [manually](/manage-users/add-and-edit/add-and-edit-users/) in Kinde. Alternatively, you can also take advantage of just-in-time (JIT) provisioning (Step 13 below) when you set up the connection.

## (Optional) Signed certificate and private key

You can increase SAML security by adding a certificate and private key pair to your setup. Your IdP will check that the certificate and private key matches, each time a user authenticates this way.

You can obtain the certificate and key from your IdP or you can generate yourself, see below.

### Generate a certificate and private key pair

1. In your preferred system, run a command to generate a certificate and key. For example, on \*nix systems, the command is: `openssl req -x509 -nodes -sha256 -days 3650 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private_key.key -out certificate.crt`.
2. This command may also work in other systems, such as WSL on Windows. Alternatively, you can try installing openssl binaries for your system.
3. Once the files are generated, save them locally.
4. Add the certificate to your IdP settings. The certificate there and the one in Kinde must match exactly. Instructions for how to do this varies, depending on your IdP.
5. Copy the certificate and private key details into Kinde as per the procedure below.

## Advanced configurations

Depending on your SAML set up, you may need to include advanced configurations for your connection. See [Advanced SAML configurations](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/advanced-saml-configurations/)

## Step 1: Add SAML connection in Kinde

### Add a connection for a specific organization

1. Go to **Organizations** and open the organization. 
2. In the menu, select **Authentication**, then select **Add connection**.
3. In the **Add connection** window, select **New enterprise connection**, then click **Next**.
4. Select the connection type you want and then select **Next**.  
5. Next: 'Step 2: Configure the connection'.

### Add a connection that can be shared across multiple organizations

1. Go to **Settings > Environment > Authentication**.
2. Scroll to the **Enterprise connection** section and select **Add connection**. The **Add connection** window opens.
3. Select the connection type you want and then select **Next**.
4. Next: 'Step 2: Configure the connection'.

## Step 2: Configure the connection

1. Enter a name for the connection. It must match the name in your SAML setup.
2. Enter an **Entity ID.** This is a value you can make up using a random alphanumeric string, e.g. `5836g209gbhw09r8y0913`. The Entity ID you enter here must be configured exactly the same in your identity provider (unless your IdP is Microsoft Azure).

3. If Microsoft is your provider and your app is a bit older, you may need to add `spn:` to the beginning of the **Entity ID** string in Kinde, e.g. `spn:5836g209gbhw09r8y0913`. This is not required for newly created apps.
4. Enter the **IdP metadata URL**. This URL comes from your identity provider.

   ![optional fields for saml](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/4f1851db-5c34-496b-ced1-07c1cd272b00/public)

5. Enter a **sign in URL** if your IdP requires a specific URL.
6. If you want, select the **Sign request algorithm** and **Protocol binding**. The options you choose will depend on what your identity provider prefers or requires.
7. Select a **Name ID** format. This helps identify and link user identities between your IdP and Kinde. 
8. Enter an **Email key attribute**. This is the attribute in the SAML token that contains the user’s email. Setting this value ensures that the email address returned in the SAML response is correctly retrieved. We do not recommend leaving this field blank, but if you do we will set ‘email’ as the attribute.
9. (Optional) Add a first name and last name key attribute.

   ![Home realm domains in SAML configuration](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/dbdccca5-2e6c-4dd8-eaec-e029574daf00/public)

10. Enter any relevant **Home realm domains**. This is how SAML recognizes a user’s credentials and routes them to the correct sign in page. Note that home realm domains need to be unique across all connections in an environment. [Read more about home realm domains](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/home-realm-discovery/).
11. If you use home realm domains, the sign in button is hidden on the auth screen by default. To show the SSO button, select the **Always show sign-in button** option. 

    ![ACS URL and custom domain option](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/885eda9c-ca4f-4340-db17-224023b8c300/public)

12. Copy the relevant reply URL: 
    1. If you don't use a custom domain, copy the **ACS URL**.
    2. If you do use a custom domain, select the **Use custom domain instead** option and copy the custom domain URL. 
    Later, add this URL to your identity provider configuration.
13. Copy the **Single Logout URL** for later use in your identity provider configuration.
14. If you want to enable just-in-time (JIT) provisioning for users, select the **Create a user record in Kinde** option. This saves time adding users manually or via API later.

15. (Temporary feature) Select if you want to treat this connection as a trusted provider. A [trusted provider](/authenticate/about-auth/identity-and-verification/) is one that guarantees the email they issue is verified.
16. If you want users to be logged out of all applications that use this connection when they logout of your app, switch on the **Single logout** option in the **Logout experience** section.
17. (Optional) In the **Sign SAML request** section, paste in the **Signed certificate** and **Private key**. You may have got these from your IdP or you may have generated yourself (see procedure above).
18. Enter any [upstream params](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/advanced-saml-configurations/#upstream-parameters) that you want to pass to the identity provider. Not all providers support this, so check their documentation first.
19. Switch on the connection. This will make it instantly available to users if this is your production environment.
    1. For environment-level connections, scroll down and select the apps that will use the auth method.
    2. For organization-level connections, scroll down and select if you want to switch this on for the org. 
20. Select **Save**.

Next: Complete any additional configuration in your identity provider's settings, such as adding the **Entity ID** and **return URL**.

## Step 2.5: Configure Single Logout in your Identity Provider

1. In your identity provider's SAML application settings, locate the **Single Logout URL** or **SLO URL** field.
2. Enter the Single Logout URL from your Kinde connection configuration.
3. Save the configuration in your identity provider.

<Aside type="info">

Single logout ensures that when users sign out of your application, they are also signed out of their identity provider session, providing a complete logout experience. The exact field name and location may vary depending on your identity provider.

</Aside>

## Step 3: Test the connection

Once you have entered the ACS URL in your identity provider, the connection should be enabled.

1. Go to your test application and attempt to sign in.
2. If you left the **Home realm domains** field blank in Kinde, when you launch your application, you should see a button to sign in. Click it and go to step 4.
3. If you completed the **Home realm domains** field, you should be redirected immediately to your IdP sign in screen.
4. Enter your IdP details and complete any additional authentication required.
