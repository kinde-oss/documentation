Passwordless authentication is a type of authentication that does not require end-users to set or maintain passwords for access to an application. Instead, they authenticate using a one-time passcode (OTP).

## About one-time passcodes (OTPs)

Kinde does not support magic links as a password alternative, instead, we prefer to use one-time passcodes (OTPs) as they are more secure, and require manual entry as opposed to a single click.

For example, someone with access to your email could click a link to get instant access to an application, but they cannot use the code unless they have initiated the correct sign in flow and have your sign-in identity as well. If you receive the OTP via SMS, someone would need to have your device and unlock code, to access it.

A OTP can be issued via email or phone, depending how you have set up authentication. It is also common to use OTPs as a factor in [multi-factor authentication](https://kinde.com/docs/authentication-and-access/about-multi-factor-authentication/).

## Set up passwordless authentication

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings >** **Authentication**.
2. In the **Passwordless** section, select **Configure** on the relevant tile.
3. If you select the **Email + code** tile:
   1. Select which applications will use this authentication method.
   2. Select **Save**.
4. If you select the **Phone** tile:

   1. Select which applications will use this authentication method.
   2. Select **Save**.

   > ⚠️ **You can test this feature** but passwordless phone authentication requires that you have a [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/en-us) account. You need to enter your Twilio account details and [upgrade to Kinde Pro](https://kinde.com/pricing/) if you want your users to authenticate this way.
