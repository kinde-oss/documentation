If you allow your business customers to set up and manage their own SSO enterprise connections in your app, this topic describes how to help manage and troubleshoot the connections.

Self-serve portal connections for accessing your site or app are fully under your control. Even though your customer can do the basic configuration, there are some things you'll probably want to manage on your side, such as provisioning behavior and other connection defaults.

## Troubleshoot self-serve SSO connections

If a customer can't sign in using the SSO connection they set up, check these things.

- They have added the ACS URL to the application on their identity provider side
- They have a verified domain (home realm domain) selected in the configuration
- The email they are trying to test belongs to the verified domain
- The credentials and certificates are all valid
- The connection is enabled and is being accessed in the relevant environment
- The org code is being passed when a user goes to sign in
- If there are any issues with upstream params being parsed
- All required fields are included in the configuration, including key attributes (if relevant)

## How to access and manage enterprise connections created by your customers

1. Open the organization for the customer.
2. In the left menu, select **Authentication**. The customer's connections are shown.
3. Select the three dots on the connection, and select **Configure**. 
4. In the connection configuration window, make the changes you want, and select **Save**.

## Enable or disable a connection

You might need to disable a connection if you think it has been compromised or at the customer's request.

1. Open the organization for the customer.
2. In the left menu, select **Authentication**. The customer's connections are shown.
3. Select the three dots menu on the connection card, and choose **Enable** or **Disable**.

## Delete a connection

This completely disables and deletes the connection. This action can't be reversed.

1. Open the organization for the customer.
2. In the left menu, select **Authentication**. The customer's connections are shown.
3. Select the three dots menu on the connection card, and choose **Delete**.
4. Confirm that you want to delete the connection.
