<Aside type="upgrade">

This feature is only available on the [Kinde Scale plan](https://kinde.com/pricing/)

</Aside>

Your business customers who have their own organizations in Kinde can set up and manage their own SSO connections. This can save time going back and forth trying to get app credentials configured. Instead, your customer (who is the Identity Provider for their users) can set up an app and use the credentials to configure a connection. While you manage Kinde settings as the Service Provider. 

## Before an organization can set up an SSO connection

- Ensure that you have switched on the option in the [self-serve portal settings](/build/self-service-portal/self-serve-portal-for-orgs/)
- Check that the person setting up the connection has the [right role and permissions](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/user-roles/). They need to be an Admin.
- Add a domain to the verified domains list for the org (see below). Connections can only be set up for verified domains.

### Add a verified domain to the customer organization in Kinde

This is like pre-setting the home realm domain for a connection.

1. Open the organization record in Kinde.
2. If prompted, in the **Activate advanced organization features** box, select **Activate**.
3. Go to **Policies** in the menu.
4. In the **Verified domains** text field, add the customer's domain or domains. Add each on a new line. Make sure you include only the domain, e.g. `mybusiness.com` and not the full domain URL such as `http://www.mybusiness.com`.
5. Select **Save**.

## Add an SSO connection via the self-serve portal (Instructions for end-users)

Provide these instructions to the customer in case they need assistance.

1. Navigate to the self-serve portal and select **SSO**.
2. Select **Add connection**.
3. Select the connection type and then select **Next**. The configuration dialog opens.
4. Add a name for the connection - this name will be shown to end users when they sign in.
5. Complete the other fields with details from your IdP, e.g. **Entity ID**, provisioning options, mapping, certificates, etc.
6. Copy the **ACS URL** - you will need to add this to your IdP application.
7. Select **Save**.

## Finish setting up the connection for the organization (Instructions for Kinde admin)

There are some enterprise connection functions that are only configurable by you in Kinde. After the customer has entered their details, you can finish setting up the connection. 

Open the connection in Kinde and adjust any of the following settings (if relevant):
- **Create a user record in Kinde** - Add users if they do not exist when signing in. This is switched on by default.
- **Always show sign-in button** - Show the SSO button on the app home screen. This is switched on by default.
- **Auto-add users** - Allows users to join the organization if their credentials are accepted. Default is switched on.
- **Upstream params** - these have the following default, but more can be added at the customer's request.
  ```txt
  { 
      "login_hint": {
	  		"alias": "login_hint"
	  	}
  }
  ```

## Make the connection available to end-users

This is the process for end-users to make the connection live. It can also be enabled in the Kinde admin.

1. Open the connection configuration dialog via the self-service portal (end users).
2. Select the **Enable for organization** option.
3. Select **Save**.

## Enable or disable a connection

1. Navigate to the self-serve portal and select **SSO**.
2. Select the three dots menu on the connection card, and choose **Enable** or **Disable**.

## Delete a connection

1. Navigate to the self-serve portal and select **SSO**.
2. Select the three dots menu on the connection card, and choose **Delete**.
3. Confirm that you want to delete the connection.
