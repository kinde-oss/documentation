<Aside type="upgrade">

This feature is only available on the [Kinde Scale plan](https://kinde.com/pricing/)

</Aside>

Your business customers who have their own organizations in Kinde, can now set up and manage their own SSO connections. This can save time going back and forth trying to swap app credentials. Instead, your customer (who is the Identity Provider for their users) can set up an app and use the credentials to configure a connection. While you manage Kinde settings as the Service Provider. 

## Before your orgs can set up a SSO connection

- Ensure that you have switched on the option in the [self-serve portal settings](/build/set-up-options/self-serve-portal-for-orgs/)
- Check that the person setting up the connection has the [right role and permissions](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/user-roles/)
- Add a domain to the verified domains list for the org (see below).

### Add a verified domain to the customer organization in Kinde

This is like pre-setting the home realm domain for a connection.

1. Open the organization record in Kinde.
2. Go to **Policies** in the menu.
3. In the **Verified domains** text field, add the customer's domain or domains. Add each on a new line. Make sure you truncate to include only the domain, e.g. `mybusiness.com` and not the full domain URL such as `http://www.mybusiness.com`.
4. Select **Save**.

## Add an SSO connection via the self-serve portal

Provide these instructions to the customer in case they need assistance.

1. Navigate to the self-serve portal and select **SSO**.
2. Select **Add connection**.
3. Select the connection type and then select **Next**. The configuration dialog opens.
4. Select the domains that are allowed to use this connection.
5. Complete the other fields with details from your IdP, e.g. **Entity ID**, provisioning options, mapping, certificates, etc.
6. Copy the **ACS URL** - you will need to add this to your IdP application.
7. If you are ready to, **Enable the connection**.
8. Select **Save**.

## Enable or disable a connection

1. Navigate to the self-serve portal and select **SSO**.
2. Select the three dots menu on the connection card, and choose **Enable** or **Disable**.

## Delete a connection

1. Navigate to the self-serve portal and select **SSO**.
2. Select the three dots menu on the connection card, and choose **Delete**.
3. Confirm that you want to delete the connection.
