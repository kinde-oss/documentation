<Aside type="upgrade">

This feature is only available on the [Kinde Scale plan](https://kinde.com/pricing/)

</Aside>

You can give specific permission for an organization to set up and manage SSO connections, without giving it to all organizations in your business. 

1. In Kinde, open the organization you want to give access.
2. In the side menu, select **Self-serve portal**.
3. Switch on the SSO function. 
4. Select **Save**.
