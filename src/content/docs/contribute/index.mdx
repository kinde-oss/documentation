## Kinde docs writing guidelines

We love that you want to help us with our docs in GitHub, so here’s our writing guidelines to help make this easier for you.

The first thing to know is that Kinde has editorial discretion over all docs and we will review and edit community contributions to keep content in line with our styles and standards.

Don’t let this stop you from raising issues or making suggestions - we need your expertise. We just don’t expect writing perfection, so we’ve got you covered.

### What to contribute

Our docs describe what Kinde does, how our platform works, the core functions, configurations, features, settings, etc. We’re not trying to cover every use case, just the most common.

Please raise an issue or suggestion if:

- Something is incorrect and needs to be fixed
- Something is under-explained and needs improvement
- You find a gap in the docs or missing information

What we are not looking for:

- Product suggestions or feature requests - please log these [here]
- Workarounds or solutions from third parties
- Non-specific feedback such as ‘bad doc, please improve’.

### How to contribute

#### Raise an issue

Let us know if a document is wrong or needs fixing. Be as specific as you can so we can address it quickly. An example is where a code snippet is incorrect, or a procedure is no longer working. For issues, provide:

- Clear descriptive titles
- Links to relevant pages/files
- Explanations as to why (or *for whom*) this is a problem
- Optional: proposed solutions

#### **Suggest a single page edit**

Suggest an improvement or change to a document by selecting **Edit this page** in your browser on the document. This will take you to GitHub where you can edit the content of the file and then create a pull request.

As part of creating the pull request, make sure you explain why the changes are needed, who they help, and how.

#### Raise a PR for bigger contributions

We prefer to write the big stuff, so we encourage people to raise issues about gaps in our content and provide suggestions that way.

However, if you want to create a new topic or edit multiple files, go to GitHub to create a branch or fork and raise a PR. There’s no guarantee your pages will be approved and merged, but we will review and get in touch to discuss and definitely consider new content for inclusion.

### How we write

Our documents are used by developers of varying experience, people from different language backgrounds, and users who are in a hurry to get the answer they need. Our guiding principle is to always use clear, simple language.

Our docs are not translated currently, but they will be soon. Plain English makes translation easier.

#### Writing principles

- Use direct, clear sentences and short paragraphs
- Use simple, plain vocabulary and phrases
- Minimize jargon, idioms, and internet shorthand
- Don’t make assumptions about what readers already know
- Explain abbreviations and acronyms in full

#### Content principles

- Use short, descriptive headings that includes keywords, so people can scan to find what they need. E.g. ‘Update redirect URLs’, instead of ‘Edit the .env file’.
- Provide clear, step-by-step instructions that any level of user could follow easily.
- Include conceptual explanations and use cases for complex topics.
- Create tidy code snippets or examples that will help users get it right.

If you think an image or screen shot is needed, just describe it and we’ll create it and add later.

### Tone and voice

- Take a friendly but casual tone, like you are explaining things to a peer or colleague.
- Don’t waffle on too much with preamble, get to the point.
- Speak with clarity and confidence. You know what you’re talking about.

## Contributing to SDKs

@Daniel Rivers if we want to add anything specific about writing for our SDKs, this is the place.

For example,

All our SDKs follow a similar structure. Refer to our most complete and up to date SDK (NextJS) as a guide.

## General document structure

Most Kinde docs follow a similar structure:

- What is the topic about and who is it for (1-2 sentences)
- Conceptual explanations with appropriate headings
- Before you begin section for prerequisites
- Procedure with steps - How to do x.
- Related topics

## Reference

### Where the main content lives

Our documentation articles are written in `mdx` and are structured as follows:

<FileTree>

- src
  - content
    - docs
      - topic
        - subtopic
          - article-1.mdx
          - article-2.mdx

</FileTree>

Most of the time you will be contributing to existing articles, but you can also suggest new ones. If that's the case, there are a few things you should know:

- If you're creating a **new article** in a existing **subtopic**, you just simply need to add the `.mdx` file within that folder along with some `frontmatter`.

- If you're creating a new **subtopic** inside an existing **topic**, you will need to edit `src/data/sidebarData.ts` and add it under `items` within the appropriate **topic**. The order you add the **subtopic** in is the order it will show up in the main menu on the left.

- If you're creating a new **topic**, this will need to be added to the same file above, but please note that we currently always have a `topic/subtopic/article` type of structure, so make sure you're accounting for that. If in doubt, please contact us and we can discuss what the best place for those would be.

### Other important places

#### SVG Icons `src/icons`

Used in various places throughout the docs, the main one being for populating SDK logos, for example.

### Frontmatter

All content files live under `src/content/docs` and

@Marcos Martini - not sure if we need to add a how to for pull requests. Let me know.
