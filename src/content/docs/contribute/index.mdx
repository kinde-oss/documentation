We love that you want to help us with our docs in GitHub, so here’s our guidelines to help make this easier for you.

The first thing to know is that Kinde has editorial discretion over all docs and we will review and edit community contributions to keep content in line with our styles and standards.

Don’t let this stop you from raising issues or making suggestions - we need your expertise. We just don’t expect writing perfection, so we’ve got you covered.

## What to contribute

Our docs describe what Kinde does, how our platform works, the core functions, configurations, features, settings, etc. We’re not trying to cover every use case, just the most common.

Please raise an issue or suggestion if:

- Something is incorrect and needs to be fixed
- Something is under-explained and needs improvement
- You find a gap in the docs or missing information

What we are not looking for:

- Product suggestions or feature requests - please log these [here](https://kinde-21631392.hs-sites.com/en-au/feature-request/)
- Workarounds or solutions from third-parties
- Non-specific feedback such as ‘bad doc, please improve’.

## How to contribute

### Raise an issue

Let us know if a document is wrong or needs fixing. Be as specific as you can so we can address it quickly. An example is where a code snippet is incorrect, or a procedure is no longer working. For issues, provide:

- Clear descriptive titles
- Links to relevant pages/files
- Explanations as to why (or *for whom*) this is a problem
- Optional: proposed solutions

### Suggest a single page edit

Suggest an improvement or change to a document by selecting **Edit this page** in your browser on the document. This will take you to GitHub where you can edit the content of the file and then create a pull request.

As part of creating the pull request, make sure you explain why the changes are needed, who they help, and how.

### Raise a PR for bigger contributions

We prefer to write the big stuff ourselves, so we encourage people to raise issues about gaps in our content and provide suggestions that way.

However, if you want to create a new topic or edit multiple files, go to GitHub to create a branch or fork and raise a PR. There’s no guarantee your pages will be approved and merged, but we will review and get in touch to discuss and definitely consider new content for inclusion.

## Contributing to SDK documentation

Our SDK docs are always evolving and we welcome suggestions and contributions to make them better.
SDK docs are stored with our other docs (see the file structure below). The SDKs themselves are stored in separate [Kinde repos](https://github.com/kinde-oss/).

## General document structure

Most Kinde docs follow a similar structure:

- What is the topic about and who is it for (1-2 sentences)
- Conceptual explanations with appropriate headings
- Before you begin section for prerequisites
- Procedure with steps - How to do x.
- Supplementary or adjacent information
- Related topics

## Where the content lives

Our documentation articles are written in `mdx` and are structured as follows:

<FileTree>

- src
  - content
    - docs
      - topic group
        - subtopic group
          - article-1.mdx
          - article-2.mdx

</FileTree>

Most of the time you will be contributing to existing articles, but you can also suggest new ones.

To create a **new article** in a existing **subtopic**, add the `.mdx` file to the relevant folder. Don't worry about the `frontmatter`, we will add this if the article is approved for publishing.

Let us know in a comment if you think the article needs to live in a new section or topic group.

Raise a PR and explain the reason for the topic, etc.

## How we write

Our documents are used by developers of varying experience, people from different language backgrounds, and users who are in a hurry to get the answer they need. Our guiding principle is to always use clear, simple language.

Our docs are not translated currently, but they will be soon. Plain English makes translation easier.

### Writing principles

- Use direct, clear sentences and short paragraphs
- Use simple, plain vocabulary and phrases
- Minimize jargon, idioms, and internet shorthand
- Don’t make assumptions about what readers already know
- Explain abbreviations and acronyms in full

### Content principles

- Use short, descriptive headings that includes keywords, so people can scan to find what they need. E.g. ‘Update redirect URLs’, instead of ‘Edit the .env file’.
- Provide clear, step-by-step instructions that any level of user could follow easily.
- Include conceptual explanations and use cases for complex topics.
- Create tidy code snippets or examples that will help users get it right.

### Tone and voice

- Take a friendly but casual tone, like you are explaining things to a peer or colleague.
- Don’t waffle on too much with preamble, get to the point.
- Speak with clarity and confidence. You know what you’re talking about.

## Docs syntax

### Frontmatter

#### <span class="text-lg font-bold">`title (required)`</span>

**type:** `string`

You must provide a title for every page. This will be displayed at the top of the page, in browser tabs, and in page metadata.

```md title="src/content/docs/developer-tools/about/our-sdks.mdx"
---
title: Kinde SDKs
---
```

#### <span class="text-lg font-bold">`page_id (required)`</span>

**type:** `uuid`

This is the internal unique `id` for the article. This will be used when referencing another articles within the `relatedArticles` frontmatter.

```md title="src/content/docs/developer-tools/about/our-sdks.mdx"
---
title: Kinde SDKs
page_id: 684fc526-a338-4a67-9af6-742a39b66aff
---
```

#### <span class="text-lg font-bold">`order`</span> (optional)

<Aside>

Providing the `order` frontmatter is completely optional and will be treated as a hint for us to where to place the file. We may update the article’s `order` upon further review.

</Aside>

**type:** `number`

Control the order of this article when sorting an autogenerated group of links under a specific topic or subtopic. Lower numbers are displayed higher up in the link group.

```md title="src/content/docs/developer-tools/about/our-sdks.mdx"
---
title: Kinde SDKs
page_id: 684fc526-a338-4a67-9af6-742a39b66aff

  order: 1

```

### Code samples

The code snippets in our docs are powered by [astro-expressive-code](https://github.com/expressive-code/). Here are some examples in how you can use them:

#### Regular syntax highlighting

For code highlighting, you will need a language identifier. (See full list of [supported languages](https://github.com/shikijs/textmate-grammars-themes/blob/main/packages/tm-grammars/README.md) on GitHub)

e.g. `js` for JavaScript:

````md title="example.mdx" ins=/^([^a-z]{3}.*)/
```js
console.log("This code is syntax highlighted!");
```
````

Will render:

```js
console.log("This code is syntax highlighted!");
```

#### Frames

If you use a language identifier that is typically used for terminal sessions or shell scripts, a terminal frame will be added to the rendered output.

````
```bash
nano script.sh
```
````

Will render:

```bash
nano script.sh
```

If you add a value for `title`, then you get a title bar:

````
```powershell title="PowerShell terminal example"
Write-Output "This one has a title!"
```
````

Result:

```powershell title="PowerShell terminal example"
Write-Output "This one has a title!"
```

If the language identifier is not a terminal sessions or shell script one, providing the `title` attribute will render the frame with the file name, for example.

````
```tsx title="src/app/page.tsx"
import { RegisterLink, LoginLink } from "@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs/components";
```
````

Output:

```tsx title="src/app/page.tsx"
import {RegisterLink, LoginLink} from "@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs/components";
```

This can also been achieved by adding a comment with the file name at the top of your file.

````text frame="none"
```tsx
// src/app/page.tsx
import { RegisterLink, LoginLink } from "@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs/components"
```
````

Output:

```tsx
// src/app/page.tsx
import {RegisterLink, LoginLink} from "@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs/components";
```

### Images

If you need an image or screen shot in your article, you’ll have to:

- Create a folder within `src/assets/images` with the same `slug` as your article (the article’s `.mdx` file name)
- The image must be at least `1440px` wide
- You should make sure the `alt` text is also added in `markdown`.

Images added to an article will be optimized on build and have some styles and zoom functionality added to it.

For example, let’s take this page, for example. This article lives under `src/docs/contribute/index.mdx` - In this case, we would create a `contribute` folder under `src/assets/images` and save the image there.

<FileTree>

- src
  - assets
    - images
      - contribute
        - penguin.jpg

</FileTree>

To add an image to an article, just simply use the `markdown` syntax like so:

```md title="src/docs/contribute/index.mdx"
![An image of a penguin](@assets/images/contribute/penguin.jpg)
```

The image will be rendered with some padding and will have the **click to zoom** functionality added to it.

![An image of a penguin](@assets/images/contribute/penguin.jpg)
