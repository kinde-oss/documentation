If you are not using [custom code for your page designs](/design/customize-with-code/customize-with-css-html/), you can still change the layout of pages (including auth pages), to control elements such as the background, alignment and position of page elements and widget.

After you’ve set the global brand, view how it looks on individual pages, and make additional changes. You can further customize:

- sign in page - what a user sees each time they sign in to their account
- sign up page - what a user sees when they first sign up to your business
- confirm sign in page (if using [passwordless](/authenticate/authentication-methods/passwordless-authentication/) authentication) - where a user enters the passwordless email code each time they sign in.
- Confirm sign up page (if using [passwordless](/authenticate/authentication-methods/passwordless-authentication/) authentication) - where a user enters the passwordless email code the first time they sign up.
- Emails - for when you send email from the company.
- Subscription page - the sign up page for new subscribers (if you use this)
- Request access page - when you're collecting a waiting list

<Aside>

To manage page design using your own CSS code, see [page design with code](/design/customize-with-code/understand-page-design/).

### To customize pages

1. Select the page you want to view or edit from the left menu.
2. Depending on the type of page you are viewing, you can edit, the background image, page layout, content, and more.
3. Select **Save** to apply changes.
4. Select **Preview** in the top right to view changes.

   <Aside>

   If the background image you choose appears cut off or too short in the preview even after you hit **Save**, it could be a CSS bug. Check how it looks in your live or test environment, where it should be fine. Let us know if you’re having issues.
