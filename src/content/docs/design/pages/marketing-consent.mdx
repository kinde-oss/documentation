If you want users to opt-in for marketing communications when they sign up to your app, you can add a consent box to the sign up screen.

The checkbox option is a Kinde property that shows in the user’s profile if they consent or not.

How you manage sending marketing material to the user, and how you allow them to opt out is up to you as a business, and is not part of this feature.

## Add the checkbox to the sign up page

You need to switch this on for each application you want it to appear for.

**Switch on the feature**

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Applications > [Your application]**.
2. On the **Details** page, scroll to the **Authentication experience** section.
3. Switch on the **Add marketing consent checkbox** option.

**Update the checkbox label**

1. Go to **Design > Pages > Sign up**.
2. On the preview side of the page, select **Edit**.
3. In the panel on the right, scroll to the **Marketing** section.
4. Add or edit the text that appears to the user.
5. Select **Save**. You can preview what it looks like.

## View or change the consent status for a user

1. In Kinde, go to **Users** and find the user who’s profile you want to view.
2. Open their profile.
3. In the left menu, select **Properties**.
4. Find the **Yes to marketing** or `kp_marketing_consent` property.
   It will either say True = They agreed; False = They did not agree.
5. If you want to change the property value:

   a. select the edit (pencil) icon.

   b. In the window that appears, change the value by selecting or deselecting the checkbox.

   c. Select **Save**.

6. Select **Save**.
