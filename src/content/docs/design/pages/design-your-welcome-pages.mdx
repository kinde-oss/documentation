When users sign up or sign into your product, they land on pages generated by Kinde. You can update the look of these pages to match your brand.

You also have the option to bring your own page design to the authentication experience. See [Custom sign-up and sign-in pages](/authenticate/custom-configurations/custom-authentication-pages/#custom-sign-up-and-sign-in-pages).

## Setting global brand elements

To ensure consistency across pages, Kinde gives you global brand options so that when you change the look on one page, the changes are automatically applied to all other pages.

Use the following procedures to make design changes to suit your brand.

## Set a light or dark theme

1. In Kinde, go to **Design > Global > Brand**.
2. Set the **Theme**: **Light**, **Dark**, or **User preference**. If you select user preference, make sure you choose a brand color scheme for both experiences. See below.
3. Select **Save**.

You can [change the light and dark theme settings for your organizations](/design/brand/apply-branding-for-an-organization/) as well.

## Add your company logo

1. In Kinde, go to **Design > Global > Brand**.
2. In the **Logo** section, upload your company logo. Make sure images are less than 1MB, are PNG, JPEG, or GIF.

   > ℹ️ The logo will be automatically linked to the [Redirect URL](/get-started/connect/callback-urls/) set for your business, or the [application homepage URL](/design/pages/link-to-homepage/) set up for each application. If you are using tracking, the URL will also reflect that the user clicked out of the sign up/sign in screen, so you can distinguish this action from successful sign ins.

3. Select **Save**.

## Change the language and name order on sign up pages

You first need to enable the language you want in the [global language settings](/design/pages/internationalization/).

1. In Kinde, go to **Design.**
2. Choose a sign up page. **Sign up** or **Request access**.
3. Select the language from the selector in the top right and then select **Save**.

For some languages, such as Hungarian and Japanese, this also switches the fields to be last name, then first name - which is the Eastern naming order.

## Add favicons for web browsers

Favicons are small icons that appear on browser tabs. To add them to Kinde, they must measure 48x48px (or multiples of, such as 96x96).

  alt=""
  width="672px"
  height="auto"
  fetchpriority="low"
  loading="lazy"
  decoding="async"
/>

1. In Kinde, go to **Design > Global > Brand**.
2. In the **Favicon** section:
   1. Add one as SVG format (so it works in most browsers).
   2. Add one as a **Fallback** PNG for other browsers, such as Safari.
3. Select **Save**.

To change the favicon of an organization, see [Apply unique branding for an organization](/design/brand/apply-branding-for-an-organization/).

## Set brand color scheme

Your selections will be inherited across all pages and for all organizations, unless you set overrides in an organization.

1. In Kinde, go to **Design > Global > Brand**.
2. Select settings and colors for **Pages**, **Cards**, **Buttons,** **Input fields**, and **Links**. Be sure to set a light and dark version of each if you want your brand colours to appear in both modes.
3. Select **Save**.
4. To preview pages, select a page type from the left menu.

To set the brand color scheme of an organization, see [Apply unique branding for an organization](/design/brand/apply-branding-for-an-organization/).

## Customize user-facing pages

After you’ve set the global brand, view how it looks on individual pages, and make additional changes. You can further customize:

- sign in page - what a user sees each time they sign in to their account
- sign up page - what a user sees when they first sign up to your business
- confirm sign in page (if using [passwordless](/authenticate/authentication-methods/set-up-user-authentication/#email-authentication) authentication) - where a user enters the passwordless email code each time they sign in.
- Confirm sign up page (if using [passwordless](/authenticate/authentication-methods/set-up-user-authentication/#email-authentication) authentication) - where a user enters the passwordless email code the first time they sign up.
- Emails - for when you send email from the company.
- Subscription page - the sign up page for new subscribers (if you use this).

### To customize pages

1. Select the page you want to view or edit from the left menu.
2. On the preview screen, select **Edit**.
3. Depending on the kind of page you are viewing, you can edit, the background image, page layout, content, and more.
4. Select **Save** to preview and apply changes.

   > ℹ️ If the background image you choose appears cut off or too short in the preview even after you hit **Save**, it could be a CSS bug. Check how it looks in your live or test environment, where it should be fine. Let us know if you’re having issues.
