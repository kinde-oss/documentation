When users sign up or sign in to your product, they land on pages generated by Kinde. You can update the look of these pages to match your brand.

You also have the option to bring your own page design to the authentication experience. See 
- [Custom design with code](/design/design-with-code/about-designing-with-code/)
- [Custom sign-up and sign-in pages](/authenticate/custom-configurations/custom-authentication-pages/).

## Setting global brand elements

You can choose to set a global theme for all pages, or else use global settings as a fallback for custom page designs.

Use the following procedures to make design changes to suit your brand.

## Add your company logo

Logos must be under 1MB, and they are resized to have a maximum width or height of 120 pixels based on the aspect ratio. SVG works best as it displays well on any screen, but PNG and other formats are accepted.

1. In Kinde, go to **Design > Global > Brand**.
2. In the **Logo** section, upload your company logo. Make sure images are less than 1MB, are PNG, JPEG, or GIF.
3. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and select the global logo fallback behavior. 
    - Enable to use the global logo as a fallback default for organizations where the logo is not available. This means the end customer will see the organization logo, if not the global level logo, and failing that, the name of the organization.
    - Disable if you want the default behavior to be show the organization logo, then the organization name, and as a last option show the global logo.
3. Select **Save**.

<Aside>

   The logo will be automatically linked to the [Redirect URL](/get-started/connect/callback-urls/) set for your business, or the [application homepage URL](/design/pages/link-to-homepage/) set up for each application. If you are using tracking, the URL will also reflect that the user clicked out of the sign up/sign in screen, so you can distinguish this action from successful sign ins.

   </Aside>

## Add favicons for web browsers

Favicons are small icons that appear on browser tabs. To add them to Kinde, they must measure 48x48px (or multiples of, such as 96x96).

<img
  src="https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/310d10e2-ab73-4aec-9872-7352aca57200/public"
  alt=""
  width="672px"
  height="auto"
  fetchpriority="low"
  loading="lazy"
  decoding="async"
/>

1. In Kinde, go to **Design > Global > Brand**.
2. In the **Favicon** section:
   1. Add one as SVG format (so it works in most browsers).
   2. Add one as a **Fallback** PNG for other browsers, such as Safari.
3. Select **Save**.

To change the favicon of an organization, see [Apply unique branding for an organization](/design/brand/apply-branding-for-an-organization/).

## Set a light or dark theme

1. In Kinde, go to **Design > Global > Brand**.
2. Set the **Theme**: **Light**, **Dark**, or **User preference**. If you select user preference, make sure you choose a brand color scheme for both experiences. See below.
3. Select **Save**.

You can [change the light and dark theme settings for your organizations](/design/brand/apply-branding-for-an-organization/) as well.

## Set brand colors for page elements

Your selections will be inherited across all pages and for all organizations, unless you set overrides.

1. In Kinde, go to **Design > Global > Brand**.
2. Select settings and colors for **Pages (backgrounds)**, **Cards**, **Buttons,** **Input fields**, and **Links**. Be sure to set a light and dark version of each if you want your brand colours to appear in both modes.
3. Select **Save**.
4. To preview pages, open the page using the side menu and select **Preview** in the top right.

To set the brand color scheme of an organization, see [Apply unique branding for an organization](/design/brand/apply-branding-for-an-organization/).
