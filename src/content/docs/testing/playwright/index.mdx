Learn how to set up Playwright for testing applications using Kinde authentication. This guide covers installation, configuration, and basic setup for end-to-end testing.

### What you need

- A [test user with email and password](/developer-tools/testing/setup-test-user-environment/).
- A [running test application](/developer-tools/testing/setup-test-user-environment/#step-3-create-a-test-application) for testing locally.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 20 or higher.

## Installation

1. Install Playwright with the following command:
    ```bash
    npm init playwright@latest
    ```

    This will create the basic Playwright folder structure and configuration files.

2. Install dotenv for environment variable management:
    ```bash
    npm install dotenv --save-dev
    ```

## Configuration

### Environment variables

1. Create a new `.env` file:
    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```

2. Add the following to the `.env` file:
    ```env
    TEST_APP_URL=https://your-app-url.com
    TEST_USER_EMAIL=test@example.com
    TEST_USER_PASSWORD=your-test-password
    ```

    <Aside type="warning" title="Important">
      Make sure to add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing sensitive information to source control.
    </Aside>

### Playwright configuration

Update your `playwright.config.ts` file with the following basic configuration:

```ts
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
import path from 'path';

dotenv.config({ path: path.resolve(__dirname, '.env') });

export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './tests',
  fullyParallel: true,
  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
  reporter: 'html',

  use: {
    baseURL: process.env.TEST_APP_URL,
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
  },

  projects: [
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
    },
  ],
});
```

## Project structure

After setup, your project should have the following structure:

```
your-project/
├── playwright.config.ts
├── .env                         # Environment variables (gitignored)
├── tests/
│   └── example.spec.ts          # Example test file
└── package.json
```

## Basic test example

Create your first test file to verify the setup:

```ts
// tests/auth.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('can visit the application', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto(process.env.TEST_APP_URL!);
  await expect(page).toHaveURL(new RegExp(new URL(process.env.TEST_APP_URL!).hostname));
});
```

## Running tests

### UI mode (recommended for development)

Open Playwright in UI mode:

```bash
npx playwright test --ui
```

This opens the Playwright Test UI where you can:
- Select a browser
- See tests run in real-time
- Debug tests interactively
- View test results and traces

### Headless mode (for CI/CD)

Run tests in headless mode:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

### Run specific tests

Run a specific test file:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/auth.spec.ts
```

## Next steps

Now that Playwright is set up, you can proceed with:

- **[Test Authentication Flows](/developer-tools/testing/playwright/test-auth-flows/)** - Learn how to test sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out flows
- **[Test Passwordless Flows](/developer-tools/testing/playwright/test-passwordless-flows/)** - Test passwordless authentication with email OTP
- **[Test Authenticated Features](/developer-tools/testing/playwright/test-auth-features/)** - Test authenticated features using saved session state
- **[Test Backend APIs](/developer-tools/testing/playwright/test-backend-apis/)** - Test backend APIs with refresh tokens

## Troubleshooting

### Playwright not found

If you get a "command not found" error, make sure Playwright is installed:

```bash
npm init playwright@latest
```

### Browsers not installed

Install Playwright browsers:

```bash
npx playwright install
```

### Environment variables not loading

Make sure `.env` exists and contains valid environment variables. You can also use environment variables directly:

```bash
TEST_APP_URL=https://your-app.com npx playwright test
```

### Cross-origin errors

When testing with Kinde, you'll need to handle redirects properly. See the [Test Authentication Flows](/developer-tools/testing/playwright/test-auth-flows/) guide for examples.

## Best practices

1. **Use environment variables**: Store sensitive data in `.env` (gitignored)
2. **Organize tests**: Group related tests in separate files
3. **Use fixtures**: Create reusable test fixtures for common setup
4. **Add test IDs**: Use `data-testid` attributes in your application for reliable selectors
5. **Handle async operations**: Use Playwright's built-in waiting mechanisms
