You can now disconnect Git repositories from workflows directly in the dashboard. This is useful when you need to switch repositories or clean up connections you’re no longer using.

## Disconnect a Git repo

1. Go to **Settings > Git repo**
2. Select **Disconnect repo**. A pop-up appears asking you to revoke access from your GitHub account.
3. Select **Continue** to go to GitHub.
4. On GitHub, go to the **Authorized GitHub Apps** tab.
5. Select **Revoke** next to **Kinde - custom code**. A pop-up appears asking you to confirm the revocation.
    - Select **I understand, revoke access**.
6. Return to the Kinde dashboard.
7. The Git repo will be disconnected from the workflow.
