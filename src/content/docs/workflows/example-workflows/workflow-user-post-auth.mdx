Trigger: `user:post_authentication`

This trigger fires after the user has completed single factor authentication (e.g email + password or Google).

<Aside type="warning">

At this stage the user is not authorized - we have not checked organization access or carried out MFA.

</Aside>

## Example use cases

### Minimize account sharing

Check previous logins by the user to see if they have carried out impossible travel or if their IP address looks suspicious. [Example code](https://github.com/kinde-starter-kits/workflow-examples/blob/main/postUserAuthentication/impossibleTravelWorkflow.ts)

### Add properties to a user

Add additional properties to a user before tokens are generated.

### Add user to organizations

If the user has been invited to join multiple organizations you can add them as this point, before going through the authorization flow.

### Determine if the user is a first time user

Users can be created in multiple ways (imported / API / via the UI / self-registration). This could well be an existing user in your own database, so we tell you if this is a new user from a Kinde perspective. i.e we create a new record so you can act accordingly. [Example code](https://github.com/kinde-starter-kits/workflow-examples/blob/main/postUserAuthentication/syncNewUserToHubspotWorkflow.ts)

## Workflow code

### Sample event object

The main argument provided to your code is the Kinde workflow `event` object which has two keys `request` and `context`. This gives you access to the reason the workflow was triggered and additional relevant datapoints. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "request": {
    "ip": "***",
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:135.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/135.0",
    "authUrlParams": {
      "state": "b9ea1131f7796a10abe8eac1b48c715575a0ffd349fb9c602e13d824",
      "orgCode": "org_12345667",
      "clientId": "cad2d86b1ac645e1957889fcb1eff0f9",
      "redirectUri": "http://localhost:3000"
    }
  },
  "context": {
    "auth": {
      "connectionId": "conn_0194ee03c226d48c6858d5a412359ed2",
      "isNewUserRecordCreated": true
    },
    "user": {
      "id": "kp_6e54d9612e8748b39557c9975bdba033"
    },
    "domains": {
      "kindeDomain": "https://newbus.localkinde.me"
    },
    "workflow": {
      "trigger": "user:post_authentication"
    },
    "application": {
      "clientId": "cad2d86b1ac645e1957889fcb1eff0f9"
    }
  }
}
```

### Example workflows

See examples on GitHub:

- [Sync new user data to Hubspot](https://github.com/kinde-starter-kits/workflow-examples/blob/main/postUserAuthentication/syncNewUserToHubspotWorkflow.ts) - Send user data and UTM tags to Hubspot when a new user record is created in Kinde.
- [Impossible travel - Trustpath integration](https://github.com/kinde-starter-kits/workflow-examples/blob/main/postUserAuthentication/impossibleTravelWorkflow.ts) - Evaluate user login risk using TrustPath's API by checking for "impossible travel" patterns based on IP and recent login activity. If high risk is detected, access is blocked proactively.
- [Sync user attributes and groups from a SAML assertion into Kinde with user properties](https://github.com/kinde-starter-kits/workflow-examples/blob/main/postUserAuthentication/syncAttributesSamlWorkflow.ts). This works with any SAML connection, as long as attributes and groups are exposed in the SAML response. Use this to sync user attributes with Kinde, and to do one-way syncs from IdP to Kinde.
