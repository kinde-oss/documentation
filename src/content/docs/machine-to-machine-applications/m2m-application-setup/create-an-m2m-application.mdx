ai-summary: Guide to creating M2M applications in Kinde including general and organization-scoped applications with app key generation.
---

This guide shows you how to create a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) application in Kinde. They are either general or organization-scoped (Organization scoped M2M apps are available on Plus and Scale plans only).

## Create a general M2M application

You will want to create a separate M2M application for each user, system, or business who needs to access your APIs. It is not secure to share access via the same tokens or app keys.

1. Go to **Settings > Applications.**
2. Select **Add Application**.
3. In the dialog that opens, give the application a name, and select **Machine to Machine** as the **Application type**.
4. Select **Save**. App keys - including **Domain** details, **Client ID** and **Client Secret** - are issued for the application.

## Create an organization-scoped M2M application

1. Go to **Organizations > [Organization] > M2M apps.**
2. Select **Add M2M application**.
3. In the dialog that opens, give the application a name, and select **Machine to Machine** as the **Application type**.
4. Select **Save**. App keys - including **Domain** details, **Client ID** and **Client Secret** - are issued for the application.
