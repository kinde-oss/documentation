## Security

- **Validate scopes**: always check that a key has the required scopes for the requested action.
- **Cache verification results**: cache positive verification results briefly to reduce load and latency.
- **Log verification attempts**: record verification attempts and outcomes for auditing.

## Performance

- **Implement caching**: cache verification results for 5â€“10 minutes where appropriate.
- **Use async verification**: avoid blocking request handlers while waiting on verification.

## Monitoring

- **Track usage**: Monitor which keys (or customers) are used most and when.
- **Set up alerts**: Alert on spikes in failed verification attempts and unusual patterns.
- **Monitor performance**: Track verification latency and error rates over time.
