Revoking an API key immediately prevents it from authenticating with your APIs. Use this when a key is no longer needed, has the wrong scopes, or is suspected to be exposed.

## How to revoke an API key

You can revoke an API key in the dashboard or via the API. Your customers can also revoke keys themselves in the self-serve portal if you have enabled self-serve API keys. See [Self-serve API keys](/api-keys/api-key-setup/self-serve-api-keys/) for more information.

### Revoke a key on behalf of a user or organization in the dashboard

- For a user-level key: **Users > [User] > API Keys > [Key] > Revoke**
- For an organization-level key: **Organizations > [Organization] > API Keys > [Key] > Revoke**

## What changes after revocation

Verification responses will indicate the key is not usable. Ensure your API enforces this:

```javascript
// After verifying the API key with Kinde
if (!verification.is_valid || verification.status !== "active") {
  return res.status(401).json({error: "Invalid or inactive API key"});
}
```

## Recommended follow-up

- If the key was in use, create a replacement key and distribute it securely
- Audit logs for usage of the revoked `key_id`
- Consider rotating other keys if there was a broader incident
