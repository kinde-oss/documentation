Scopes define what permissions an API key has when making requests to your API.

The list of all available scopes for an API is defined at the API level. Read more about creating [scopes](/developer-tools/your-apis/custom-api-scopes/).

This guide will cover how to think about assigning scopes to API keys.

## Example custom scopes

- `read:ai_chats`
- `write:ai_chat`
- `read:ai_analytics`
- `write:ai_analytics`
- `read:ai_workflows`

## Scope configuration

### When creating an API key

1. Select the minimum required scopes for your use case
2. Consider the principle of least privilege
3. Review scope descriptions carefully

### Updating existing API keys

API keys are immutable, so you can't update the scopes of an existing API key. You can create a new API key with the desired scopes.

## Scope best practices

### Security

- **Principle of least privilege**: Only grant the minimum required scopes
- **Regular review**: Periodically review and audit scope assignments
- **Scope isolation**: Use different API keys for different purposes

### Structure

- **Naming conventions**: Use clear, descriptive scope names
- **Documentation**: Document what each scope provides access to
- **Versioning**: Consider scope versioning for breaking changes

## Scope validation

When your application receives a token, validate that it has the required scopes:

```javascript
function hasRequiredScope(token, requiredScope) {
  const scopes = token.scope.split(" ");
  return scopes.includes(requiredScope);
}

// Example usage
if (!hasRequiredScope(decodedToken, "users:write")) {
  return res.status(403).json({error: "Insufficient scope"});
}
```
