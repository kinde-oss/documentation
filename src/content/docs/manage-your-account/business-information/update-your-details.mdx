You can change some business details in Kinde, but you may need to contact support for help with other changes.

## Change your sign in name

1. On the Kinde home page, select the avatar menu at the bottom left.
2. In the menu that opens, select **Account**.
3. Make the changes you want and select **Save**.

## Change the email you sign in to Kinde with

You cannot directly edit the email address you use to sign in to Kinde. However, you can switch your sign-in email by inviting your new email address to the business, promoting it to an Owner, and then removing the old account.

### 1. Add the new email address and promote the new email to Owner

1. Send a team invitation to the new email address.
2. Accept the invitation via the new email to join the Kinde business.
3. Sign in with your **current** (old) Owner account.
4. On the Kinde home page, select the avatar menu at the bottom left, in the menu that opens, select **Team members**.
5. Find the new email address in the list and click the three dots (`...`) next to it.
6. Select **Edit roles**, choose **Owner**, and save the changes.

### **2. Remove the old email address (If applicable)**

1. Sign out, then sign back in using the **new** email address (which now has Owner permissions).
2. Go to **Settings** > **Team members** > **Members**.
3. Find the old email address in the list.
4. Click the three dots (`...`) and select **Edit roles**.
5. Change the role from **Owner** to another role (e.g., "Admin" or "Member") and save.
> **Note:** You must change the role first because Owners cannot remove other Owners.


* Once the role is updated, click the three dots (`...`) again and select **Remove member**.


## Change business details

1. On the Kinde home page, select the avatar menu at the bottom left.
2. In the menu that opens, select **Business settings**.
3. Select **Business Details**. You can only change your business name, this will not impact your kinde business URL that was already created.
4. Select **Save**.

## Change invoicing details

If you need to change business details such as tax information, email or contacts for invoices, please email support@kinde.com. Supply your business name, Kinde domain, and the details that need to be changed.
