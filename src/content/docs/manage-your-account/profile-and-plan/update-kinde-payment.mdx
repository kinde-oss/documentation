Kinde’s approach to charging subscription fees is to deduct a payment for paid plans on the monthly anniversary of your sign up, calculated in arrears. So if you signed up on 1 December, your first bill will be issued on 1 January, for usage in December.

Use the procedures below to keep your credit card details up to date.

## Add new payment method

1. On the Kinde home page, select the avatar menu at the bottom left and then select **Business Settings**.
2. In the window that opens, select **Payment details**. If you have already entered payment details, they will appear here.
3. Select **Add payment method**.
4. In the window that appears, add your credit card details and follow the prompts to save.

## Change default payment method

1. Add the new payment details as per the above procedure.
2. Select the three dots on the card showing the new details, and select **Set as default**.

## Remove a payment method

If you are on a paid plan, add a new payment method before removing the old method.

1. On the Kinde home page, select the avatar menu at the bottom left and then select **Business Settings**.
2. In the window that opens, select **Payment details**. All your payment methods are shown in this section.
3. Select the three dots on the payment method you want to remove, select **Remove**.
4. In the message that appears, confirm that you want to remove the payment method.
