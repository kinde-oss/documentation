Kinde offers multiple plans, including a free plan.

When you decide to upgrade to a higher plan, charges apply, including:

- a base subscription price
- metered usage charges (e.g. for MAU)
- unit costs for expanding feature capacity (e.g. for adding more environments)
- other recurring costs

You can upgrade or downgrade plans at any time.

## How plan charges work

When you buy a plan or upgrade, you will be immediately charged the base subscription price for the month ahead.

On the following invoice (after the first monthly billing cycle), you will be charged for any metered and unit costs for the previous month, plus the monthly base subscription price for the next month.

We currently accept credit cards as a means of payment, and use Stripe to process and secure transactions. Custom invoicing arrangements (e.g. by bank transfer, annual, currency) are available to enterprise customers.

## How to change your plan

You’ll see multiple upgrade prompts throughout the Kinde interface, with a button for upgrading and choosing a plan. Click any of these prompts and you will be shown the plan selector and guided through the sign-up process. Or you can do the following:

1. On the Kinde home page, select the avatar menu at the bottom left, and then select **Business settings**.
2. In the window that opens, select **Plan**. 
3. At the top of the window, select **Change plan**. The plan selector opens.
4. Select the plan you want to change to. 
   - If you upgrade, you will be immediately charged the full subscription price. Upgrade features are available immediately.
   - If you downgrade, you can still use Kinde until the end of your billing period. Remember to [export your data](https://docs.kinde.com/manage-your-account/your-data/exporting-data/)

You’ll be asked to confirm credit card details each time you upgrade, even if it’s from a paid plan to a paid plan.

## Refunds for downgrade

If you downgrade, we can partially refund the monthly base subscription price for unused days. You will still need to pay for anything metered that you use.

## Cancelling your Kinde plan

We don't have self-serve for cancelling plans, but you can downgrade to the free plan to avoid further charges, then also delete your business if you want. 

We want your experience at Kinde to be great, even if you decide to leave us. You can be assured that we will err on the side of crediting back any costs that you should not be charged for.

To discuss any concerns, contact support@kinde.com and we will sort it out.
