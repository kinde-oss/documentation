# Delete a business

> ⚠️ Only businesses on a free plan can self-serve delete. All businesses on paid plans need to contact Kinde support.

Deleting a business in Kinde is a nuclear action that cannot be reversed. Here’s what you need to know about deleting a Kinde business.

When you delete a business:

- All environments, applications, organizations, users, and stored data is destroyed.
- Owner, admin, and team member access to the business is removed
- Any connections and integrations you set up will break

Once you delete a business, the action cannot be reversed.

## Before you delete a business

- Consider if downgrading might be what you want to do instead.
- [Export your data](/manage-your-account/your-data/exporting-data/#_top).

## Delete your business

1. Sign in to the business you want to delete.
2. Go to **Settings > Business > Details**.
3. Scroll to the the **Admin functions** section and select **Delete business**.
4. Confirm the action in the dialog by selecting **Delete business**. The business is deleted and can no longer be accessed.

## Other information

Team members who have access to multiple businesses can still access those businesses. 

If you have other Kinde businesses, the data in those businesses will not be affected.
