There are two ways to manage user API scopes.

- Include API scopes in roles and assign the role to the user
- Add additional API scopes to the user (in addition to role)

You also have the option to add API scopes for users through the `permissions` claim.

## Before you begin

- Make sure the scopes already exist for your API. See [Create and manage API scopes](/developer-tools/your-apis/custom-api-scopes/)
- Add your API as an `audience` in the .env file of your SDK. For example, request multiple audiences by providing a white space separated list:

```

KINDE_AUDIENCE=<your-api-1> <your-api-2>

```

## Apply API scopes via user role

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Roles**.
2. Add a new role or edit an existing role.
3. In the dialog that appears, switch on **API scopes** at the bottom of the window.
4. Select **Save**.
5. Go back to the home page in Kinde.
6. Select **Users**.
7. Find and open the record for the user you want.
8. Select **Roles** in the menu.
9. [Assign the role with the relevant scopes to the user](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/apply-roles-and-permissions-to-users/).

## Apply additional API scopes for a user

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Users**.
2. Find and open the record for the user you want.
3. Select **API scopes** in the side menu.
4. In the **Additional API scopes** section, select **Add scopes**.
5. In the dialog, switch on the scopes you want.
6. Select **Save**.

## View API scopes for a user

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Users**.
2. Find and open the record for the user you want.
3. Select **API scopes** in the side menu. All the scopes applied to the user - via role and additional - are shown.

## Include API scopes in the permissions claim

You can include API scopes in the `permissions` claim if you want them included as part of the userâ€™s Access token.

1. Go to **Settings > Applications** and select **View details** on the relevant application for the permissions.
2. Select **Tokens** in the side menu.
3. Scroll to the **Token customization** section and select **Customize** on the **Access token** tile.
4. In the dialog, switch on **Include API scopes in the `permissions` claim.**
5. Select **Save**.
