<Aside type="upgrade">

You must be on the [Kinde Plus or Scale plan](https://kinde.com/pricing/) to use this feature.

</Aside>

Kinde lets you add custom scopes to help manage others who access to your APIs. Scopes define token permissions used by your APIs, and provide a reliable way to control access to your API resources.

You need to have [registered your APIs](/developer-tools/your-apis/register-manage-apis/) in Kinde to secure them using scopes.

<Aside>

Note that this topic is NOT about adding custom scopes for the Kinde Management API, it is only related to adding custom scopes to your own APIs. For information about Kinde Management API scopes, see [this topic](/developer-tools/kinde-api/connect-to-kinde-api/).

## Benefits of using scopes

- **Granular control**: Instead of broad permissions like `read` or `write`, you can create scopes tailored to different levels of access, such as `read:userprofile` or `write:roles`.
- **Security**: You only need to grant the permissions necessary for each operation, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data or actions within your system.
- **Flexibility**: As your application grows and requirements change, you can easily add, remove, or modify scopes without affecting other parts of your system.
- **Better UX**: They simplify the authorization process and improve overall user experience.
- **Compliance**: They help you align with regulatory requirements or industry standards by ensuring that access to sensitive data is properly managed and audited.

## Add scopes to an API

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > APIs**.
2. Select **View details** on the API you want to add scopes for.
3. In the menu, select **Scopes**.
4. Select **Add scope**.
5. In the **Add scope** window, enter a name for the scope. This will be the name you use in your code to recognize the scope. We recommend following a consistent naming convention, such as `read:user_status` or `write:mobilephone`.
6. Add a description that explains what the scope is for and what it does.
7. Select **Save**.
8. Repeat from step 4 for all the scopes you want to add for this API.
9. Repeat from step 1 to add scopes for a different API.

## Authorize and enable scopes for an application

1. Go to **Settings > Applications** and select **View details** on the relevant application.
2. Select **APIs** in the side menu.
3. If the application is not yet authorized, select the three dots menu next to the API you’re giving the app access to, and then select **Authorize application**.
4. In the same three dots menu, select **Manage scopes**.
5. In the window that opens, switch on or off the scopes allowed for the application.
6. Select **Save**.

## Edit and delete scopes

<Aside type="warning">

Take care deleting scopes. If a scope is in use, it can cause breaking changes for users and applications that are dependent on them.

</Aside>

1. Go to **Settings > APIs** and select **View details** on the relevant API tile.
2. Select **Scopes** in the menu.
3. Find the scope you want to change.
4. Select the dots menu (far right) and select:
   - **Edit scope.** You can only change the scope description. Select **Save**.
   - **Delete scope**. Confirm that you want to delete and select **Delete scope**.

## Request a subset of scopes for an authorized application

By default token requests for an authorized application will return all the scopes you enabled in the section above.
You can also optionally ask for a subset of your enabled scopes to be returned by including them in the body of your access token request.
