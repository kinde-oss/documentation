<Aside type="upgrade">

You may need to [upgrade plans](/manage-your-account/profile-and-plan/change-kinde-plan/) to use this feature

</Aside>

Kinde lets you manage scopes for access to your APIs. Scopes define token permissions used by your APIs, and provide a reliable way to control access to API resources.

You need to have [registered your APIs](/developer-tools/your-apis/register-manage-apis/) in Kinde to secure them using scopes.

## Benefits of using scopes

- **Granular control**: Instead of broad permissions like `read` or `write`, you can create scopes tailored to different levels of access, such as `read:userprofile` or `write:roles`.
- **Security**: You only need to grant the permissions necessary for each operation, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data or actions within your system.
- **Flexibility**: As your application grows and requirements change, you can easily add, remove, or modify scopes without affecting other parts of your system.
- **Better UX**: They simplify the authorization process and improve overall user experience.
- **Compliance**: They help you align with regulatory requirements or industry standards by ensuring that access to sensitive data is properly managed and audited.

## Add scopes to an API

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > APIs**.
2. Select **View details** on the API you want to add scopes for.
3. In the menu, select **Scopes**.
4. Select **Add scope**.
5. In the **Add scope** window, enter a name for the scope. This will be the name you use in your code to recognize the scope. We recommend following a consistent naming convention, such as `read:user_status` or `write:mobilephone`.
6. Add a description that explains what the scope is for and what it does.
7. Select **Save**.
8. Repeat from step 4 for all the scopes you want to add for this API.
9. Repeat from step 1 to add scopes for a different API.

## Authorize and enable scopes for an application

1. Go to **Settings > Applications** and select **View details** on the relevant application.
2. Select **APIs** in the side menu.
3. If the application is not yet authorized, select the three dots menu next to the API youâ€™re giving the app access to, and then select **Authorize application**.
4. In the same three dots menu, select **Manage scopes**.
5. In the window that opens, switch on or off the scopes allowed for the application.
6. Select **Save**.

## Edit and delete scopes

<Aside type="warning">

Take care deleting scopes. If a scope is in use, it can cause breaking changes for users and applications that are dependent on them.

</Aside>

1. Go to **Settings > APIs** and select **View details** on the relevant API tile.
2. Select **Scopes** in the menu.
3. Find the scope you want to change.
4. Select the dots menu (far right) and select:
   - **Edit scope.** You can only change the scope description. Select **Save**.
   - **Delete scope**. Confirm that you want to delete and select **Delete scope**.
