In order to call the Kinde Management API, you will need a Kinde management API access token. These tokens are generated by using an authorized M2M application to call the Kinde token endpoint.

This guide shows you how to set up a new machine to machine (M2M) application, and authorize it for Kinde Management API access.

## Step 1: Add a machine to machine application

1. Go to **Settings > Applications**.
2. Select **Add Application**. The **Add application** dialog opens.
3. Give the application a name, and select **Machine to Machine** as the **Application type**.
4. Select **Save**. App keys - including Domain details, Client ID and Client Secret - are issued for the application.
5. Select **View details** on the new application and copy the app keys. You need these details to test or initiate access requests from your application or service to Kinde's API. See Step 4 below.

## Step 2: Authorize the M2M application

Only authorized M2M applications are allowed to access the Kinde management API. Without this step you will receive an error when calling the Kinde management API.

1. Select **View details** on the M2M application you just created.
2. On the left, select **APIs**.
3. Select the three dots next to the Kinde Management API, then choose **Authorize application**.

## Step 3: Select scopes

Each Kinde endpoint requires specific permissions to be present in the token, to grant access to it. These are known as scopes. If a scope is not in the access token, the API will return an error indicating which scope is required.

1. Select the three dots next to the relevant Kinde management API, then choose **Manage scopes**.
2. Select the scopes you want to include in the token. For maximum security only enable the minimum scopes you require.
3. Select **Save**.

## Step 4: Get an access token and call the Kinde Management API

Follow [this guide for accessing Kinde Management API](/developer-tools/kinde-api/access-token-for-api/). The guide includes steps for how to obtain and use a token.

### How M2M tokens are calculated in Kinde

An M2M token is generated each time you call the `/oauth2/token` Kinde API endpoint to retrieve an M2M access token.

Where an access token is re-used - say where the same token is used to make another API request, this does not count as a new token. Similarly, where a token is re-used to make calls to other Kinde-registered APIs, this is also not counted as another token.

Kinde’s free and Pro plans have a generous amount of M2M tokens included, before we start charging for them. For details, see our [pricing page](https://kinde.com/pricing/).
