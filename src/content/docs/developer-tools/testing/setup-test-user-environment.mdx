Before you begin testing your application with Kinde authentication, you need to set up dedicated test users and configure your test environment. This setup is common across all testing methods, whether you're testing backend APIs, authentication flows, or authenticated features.

### What you need

- A [Kinde](https://kinde.com) account (Sign up for free)

## Why separate test users and environments?

Using dedicated test infrastructure for automated testing provides several benefits:

- **Data isolation**: Test data doesn't mix with production user data
- **Reliability**: Tests won't be affected by real user activity
- **Security**: Test credentials are separate from production credentials
- **Compliance**: Easier to manage test data retention and privacy requirements
- **Stability**: Test users can be configured with specific permissions and settings

## Step 1: Create a test environment

1. Sign in to your Kinde dashboard, select **Production** arrow, a pop-up appears
    - Select **All environments**

2. Select **Add environment**, a pop-up appears
3. Enter the environment name and code (e.g., "Test")
4. Select **Save**

You are now in the test environment.

## Step 2: Create a test user

1. Go to **Users** tab, select **Add user**
2. Enter test user details:
   - **First name/Last name**: (e.g., "John Doe")
   - **Email**: Use a clear test email (e.g., `e2e-test@yourcompany.com`)
3. Select **Save**

Repeat this process for each test user you need to create.

## Step 3: Configure a test application

1. Go to your Kinde dashboard, and select **Add application**
2. Enter a name for the application (e.g., "Test Application")
3. Select the application type (e.g., "Back-end web"),
3. Select **Save**
4. On the **Quick start** page, select a technology (e.g., "Next.js"), and select **Save**
5. Set the callback URLs
6. Go to **Authentication**:
    1. Uncheck **Email + code**
    2. Check **Email + password**
    ![email password authentication in kinde](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/9fec048c-4c89-40ee-405c-1b131d757300/public)
7. Select **Save**

    Optional: Go to **Tokens** where you can configure a custom token expiration time.

## Step 4: Finish test user account creation

1. Set up and run the test application, you can use the [Kinde Next.js test application](https://github.com/tamalchowdhury/kinde-test-application) for running tests locally
2. Sign in with the test user you created
3. Verify the email address and setup a strong password
4. Store the test user email and password for the tests

## Best practices

- **Document test resources**: Keep track of test users, applications, and their purposes
- **Regular maintenance**: Rotate test credentials periodically and clean up unused test data
- **Clear naming**: Use consistent naming conventions for easy identification

## Next steps

After the above steps, you now have:

- A test environment
- A test user with email and password
- A test application

You can now start testing your application with Kinde authentication such as [backend API testing with Jest](/developer-tools/testing/backend-api-testing/).
