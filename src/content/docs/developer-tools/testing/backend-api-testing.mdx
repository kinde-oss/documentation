---

In this guide, we'll show you how to test backend APIs using Kinde refresh tokens for maintaining authenticated sessions in automated tests, including token rotation and CI/CD integration.

### What you need

- A test user with email and password created in the [test user and environment setup](/developer-tools/testing/setup-test-user-environment/) guide.

## How it works

For automated backend tests, you can establish a long-running auth session using refresh tokens. This allows your test infrastructure to maintain authentication without manual sign-ins.

1. Perform a one-time browser-based sign-in with a test user
2. Extract the refresh token from that session
3. Store the refresh token securely (e.g., GitHub Secrets, AWS Secrets Manager)
4. Rotate tokens programmatically at the start of each test run

The access token obtained this way is identical to what your production users receive.

## Step 1: Obtain initial tokens

1. Run your test application locally
2. Sign in with your test user in a browser
3. Right click on the page and select **Inspect** to open the browser developer tools
4. Navigate to the **Application** tab and select **Cookies** > `http://localhost:3000`
5. Select the `refresh_token` and `access_token` cookies and copy their values, you will need these in the next step

## Step 2: Configure token rotation in tests

At the start of your test suite (e.g., in `jest.setup.js` or equivalent), exchange your stored refresh token for fresh tokens:

```bash
curl --location 'https://<your_subdomain>.kinde.com/oauth2/token' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data-urlencode 'client_id=<your_client_id>' \
  --data-urlencode 'grant_type=refresh_token' \
  --data-urlencode 'refresh_token=<stored_refresh_token>'
```

The response includes both a new `access_token` and a new `refresh_token`:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIs...",
  "refresh_token": "v1.MjEyNjM1OTU5...",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 86400
}
```

## Step 3: Update your stored token

After each token exchange:

1. Update your secret manager with the new `refresh_token`
2. Set the `access_token` as an environment variable for use in tests

**Example: jest.setup.js**

```jsx
// Example: jest.setup.js
const response = await fetch('https://your-subdomain.kinde.com/oauth2/token', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' },
  body: new URLSearchParams({
    client_id: process.env.KINDE_CLIENT_ID,
    grant_type: 'refresh_token',
    refresh_token: process.env.KINDE_REFRESH_TOKEN,
  }),
});

const tokens = await response.json();
process.env.KINDE_ACCESS_TOKEN = tokens.access_token;

// Update your secret manager with tokens.refresh_token for the next run
```

## Step 4: Run the tests

## Important considerations

### Token rotation

After exchange, the previous refresh token remains valid for approximately 30 seconds (grace period), then becomes invalid. Always use the most recently issued refresh token.

### Secure storage

Never commit tokens to source control. Use secret managers like GitHub Secrets, AWS Secrets Manager, or similar.

### Token refresh frequency

Refresh tokens at the start of each test run to ensure fresh access tokens.

## What's not supported

The following limitations apply to backend API testing with refresh tokens:

- **Social provider tokens**: Refresh tokens obtained through social sign-in may have different expiration behaviors
- **Organization-scoped tokens**: If testing organization-specific APIs, ensure your test user belongs to the correct organization
- **M2M tokens**: Machine-to-machine applications use different token mechanisms (see [M2M documentation](/machine-to-machine-applications/about-m2m/))

## Reference documentation

- [Refresh Tokens Guide](/build/tokens/refresh-tokens/)
- [Configure Tokens](/build/tokens/configure-tokens/)
- [Token Customization](/build/tokens/token-customization/)

## Best practices

1. **Isolate test environments**: Use separate Kinde environments or organizations for testing
2. **Use dedicated test users**: Don't use real user accounts for automated testing
3. **Rotate credentials regularly**: Even test credentials should follow security best practices
4. **Handle token expiry gracefully**: Build retry logic into your tests for token refresh failures
5. **Monitor test reliability**: Track flaky tests related to authentication timing issues
