<Aside type="info">

**Last updated: January 27, 2025**

We're continuously improving Kinde and expanding testing capabilities. This documentation is regularly updated to reflect the latest supported use cases and best practices.

</Aside>

Many customers want to implement end-to-end testing on their onboarding (sign-up) and sign-in flows. This guide covers the testing approaches that are currently possible with Kinde authentication.

## What's possible

You can test applications that use Kinde authentication in the following ways:

### Backend API Testing

- **Refresh token-based testing**: Use refresh tokens to maintain long-running authenticated sessions for API tests
- **Token rotation**: Programmatically rotate tokens at the start of each test run
- **CI/CD integration**: Store tokens securely in secret managers (GitHub Secrets, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- **Backend API validation**: Test your protected API endpoints without browser automation

### UI End-to-End Testing

- **Full authentication flows**: Test complete sign-up and sign-in flows using browser automation tools
- **Multiple tool support**: Use Playwright, Cypress, AWS CloudWatch Synthetic Canaries, or other browser automation tools
- **Passwordless flows**: Test email OTP authentication flows using email testing services
- **Authenticated feature testing**: Test protected routes and features after authentication
- **State reuse**: Save and reuse authentication state across multiple tests for efficiency

## What's not supported

The following use cases are currently **not supported** or have limitations:

- **Social provider testing**: Automated testing of social sign-in flows (Google, GitHub, etc.) is not directly supported due to third-party provider restrictions
- **MFA testing**: Testing multi-factor authentication flows may require manual intervention or specialized test infrastructure
- **Enterprise SSO testing**: Testing SAML/SSO enterprise connections requires coordination with identity providers and may not be fully automatable
- **Real-time email verification**: Testing email verification flows requires access to test email inboxes (use services like Mailosaur or Mailtrap)

<Aside type="warning">

If you need to test unsupported use cases, consider using manual testing or staging environments with test identity providers.

## Choose your testing approach

### Testing APIs or Backend Services?

If you're testing backend APIs or services that require authentication, use the refresh token approach:

**[Backend API Testing with Refresh Tokens](/developer-tools/testing/backend-api-testing/)** - Learn how to set up long-running authenticated sessions using refresh tokens for API testing.

### Testing Sign-Up or Sign-In Flows?

If you need to test the complete authentication user experience (sign-up, sign-in, sign-out), use browser automation:

**[Testing Authentication Flows](/developer-tools/testing/testing-authentication-flows/)** - Learn how to test sign-up and sign-in flows using browser automation tools like Playwright, Cypress, and AWS CloudWatch Synthetic Canaries.

### Testing Authenticated Features?

If you want to test features that require authentication (dashboard, profile pages, etc.), use Playwright with saved authentication state:

**[Testing Authenticated Features with Playwright](/developer-tools/testing/testing-authenticated-features-playwright/)** - Comprehensive guide to testing authenticated features efficiently using Playwright, including reusing authentication state and CI/CD integration.

## Best practices

Regardless of which approach you choose, follow these best practices:

1. **Use dedicated test users**: Create separate test users in Kinde for automated testing
2. **Isolate test environments**: Use separate Kinde environments or organizations for testing
3. **Secure credential storage**: Never commit tokens or passwords to source control; use secret managers
4. **Handle token expiry gracefully**: Build retry logic for token refresh failures
5. **Monitor test reliability**: Track flaky tests related to authentication timing issues
