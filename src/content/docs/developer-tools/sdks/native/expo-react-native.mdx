The Kinde React Native SDK allows developers to quickly and securely integrate a new or an existing React Native application into the Kinde platform. This SDK is for people using Expo.

## Supported versions

We support Expo with React Native versions 0.70 and higher.

Use this document for Expo and React Native.

To use just React Native see [React Native SDK](/developer-tools/sdks/native/react-native-sdk/). You can also view the [React Native docs](https://github.com/kinde-oss/kinde-react-native-sdk-0-7x) and [React Native starter kit](https://github.com/kinde-oss/kinde-react-native-sdk-0-7x) in GitHub.

## Register for Kinde

If you haven’t already got a Kinde account, [register for free here](https://app.kinde.com/register) (no credit card required). Registering gives you a Kinde domain, which you need to get started, e.g. `yourapp.kinde.com`.

## Before you install

You will need Node, the React Native command line interface, a JDK, Android Studio (for Android) and Xcode (for iOS).

Follow [the installation instructions for your chosen OS](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to install dependencies.

## **Installation with Expo Managed Workflow**

```shell
npm i @kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-7x
yarn add @kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-7x
pnpm i @kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-7x
```

## **Installation with Bare React Native**

### **Android**

1. The SDK can be installed using your package manager or `expo` cli

   ```shell
   # npm
   npm i @kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-7x
   # yarn
   yarn add @kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-7x
   # pnpm
   pnpm i @kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-7x

   # With Expo CLI
   expo install @kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-7x
   # With Expo CLI (npx)
   npx expo install @kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-7x

   ```

2. Configure the deep link support for your app

   ```shell
   npx uri-scheme add <your scheme>

   # npx uri-scheme add myapp

   ```

3. Edit `android/settings.gradle`

   ```java
   ...

   include ':react-native-keychain'
   project(':react-native-keychain').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-keychain/android')

   include ':react-native-inappbrowser-reborn'
   project(':react-native-inappbrowser-reborn').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-inappbrowser-reborn/android')
   ...

   ```

4. Edit `android/app/build.gradle`

   ```java
   apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

   android {
     ...
   }

   dependencies {
     ...

     implementation project(':react-native-keychain')
   	implementation project(':react-native-inappbrowser-reborn')

     ...
   }

   ```

5. Edit `MainApplication.java`

   ```java
   ...
   import com.oblador.keychain.KeychainPackage;
   import com.proyecto26.inappbrowser.RNInAppBrowserPackage;
   ...

   public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {
       private final ReactNativeHost mReactNativeHost =
         new ReactNativeHost(this) {
           ...
           @Override
           protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
   					...
             List<ReactPackage> packages = new PackageList(this).getPackages();
             packages.add(new KeychainPackage());
             packages.add(new RNInAppBrowserPackage());
   					...
             return packages;
           }
           ...
         };

     ...
   }
   ...

   ```

   In React Native version 0.73 or above, the `MainApplication.java` file has been replaced with `MainApplication.kt`

   ```kotlin
   import com.oblador.keychain.KeychainPackage;
   import com.proyecto26.inappbrowser.RNInAppBrowserPackage;
   ...

   class MainApplication : Application(), ReactApplication {
       override val reactNativeHost: ReactNativeHost =
         object : DefaultReactNativeHost(this) {
           override fun getPackages(): List<ReactPackage> =
               PackageList(this).packages.apply {
                 // Packages that cannot be autolinked yet can be added manually here, for example:
                 // add(MyReactNativePackage())
                 add(KeychainPackage());
                 add(RNInAppBrowserPackage());
               }

           ...
         }

     ...
   }
   ```

6. Execute the command `yarn run android` or `npx expo run:android`

### **iOS**

1. Install the **CocoaPods**. We recommend installing **CocoaPods** using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

   ```shell
   # Install CocoaPods via brew
   brew install cocoapods

   ```

2. Install the SDK

   ```shell
   expo install @kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-7x expo-secure-store expo-web-browser expo-constants
   // or
   npx expo install @kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-7x expo-secure-store expo-web-browser expo-constants

   ```

3. Add the following to your `Podfile` and run pod update:

   ```swift
   pod 'RNKeychain', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-keychain'
   pod 'RNInAppBrowser', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-inappbrowser-reborn'

   ```

   ```shell
   cd ios && pod update

   ```

4. Execute the command `yarn run ios` or `npx expo run:ios`

If you encounter any errors during the SDK installation process, you can refer to the **General tips** section at the bottom of this document, for troubleshooting guidance.

## K**inde configuration**

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Applications.**
2. Select **View details** on the **Frontend app**.
3. Scroll down to the **Callback URLs** section.
4. Add in the callback URLs for your React Native app, which should look something like this:
   - Allowed callback URLs - `<myapp://localhost:3000>/kinde_callback`
   - Allowed logout redirect URLs - `<myapp://localhost:3000>/kinde_callback`

Make sure you press the Save button at the bottom of the page!

Note: The `<myapp://localhost:3000>/kinde_callback/kinde_callback` is used as an example of local URL Scheme, change to the local URL Scheme or production URL Scheme that you use.

## Environments

If you would like to use our Environments feature as part of your development process. You will need to create them first within your Kinde account. In this case you would use the Environment subdomain in the code block above.

## Configure your app

### **Environment variables**

Put these variables in your .env file. You can find these variables on the same page as where you set the callback URLs.

- `KINDE_ISSUER_URL` - your Kinde domain
- `KINDE_POST_CALLBACK_URL` - After the user authenticates we will callback to this address. Make sure this URL is under your allowed callback URLs
- `KINDE_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL` - where you want users to be redirected to after logging out. Make sure this URL is under your allowed logout redirect URLs
- `KINDE_CLIENT_ID` - you can find this on the App Keys page

```jsx
KINDE_ISSUER_URL=https://<your_kinde_subdomain>.kinde.com
KINDE_POST_CALLBACK_URL=<myapp://localhost:3000>/kinde_callback
KINDE_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL=<myapp://localhost:3000>/kinde_callback
KINDE_CLIENT_ID=<your_kinde_client_id>

```

Note: The `myapp://localhost:3000/kinde_callback` is used as an example of local URL Scheme, change to the local URL Scheme or production URL Scheme that you use.

## Configuration deep link

### **Linking to your app**

To link to your [development](https://docs.expo.dev/development/introduction/) build or standalone app, you need to specify a custom URL scheme for your app. You can register a scheme in your Expo config (**app.json**, **app.config.js**) by adding a string under the `scheme` key:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "scheme": "myapp",
    ...
  }
}

```

### **Linking to Expo Go**

[Expo Go](https://expo.dev/expo-go) uses the `exp://` scheme, however, if we link to `exp://` without any address afterward, it will open the app to the home screen.

In development, your app will live at a url like `exp://127.0.0.1:19000`. When published, an experience will be hosted at a URL like  `exp://u.expo.dev/[project-id]?channel-name=channel-name]&runtime-version=[runtime-version]`, where `u.expo.dev/[project-id]` is the hosted URL that Expo Go fetches from.

**Caution**: You also should update your callback URL to both your app and Kinde.

```jsx
KINDE_ISSUER_URL=https://your_kinde_domain.kinde.com
KINDE_POST_CALLBACK_URL=exp://your_machine_ip:your_machine_port // f.e: exp://127.0.0.1:19000
KINDE_CLIENT_ID=your_kinde_client_id
KINDE_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL=exp://your_machine_ip:your_machine_port // f.e: exp://127.0.0.1:19000

```

## Integrate with your app

To create a new instance of the KindeSDK object, execute the code below.

```jsx
...
import { KindeSDK } from '@kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-7x';
...

...
const client = new KindeSDK(YOUR_KINDE_ISSUER, YOUR_KINDE_REDIRECT_URI, YOUR_KINDE_CLIENT_ID, YOUR_KINDE_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI);
...

```

## Sign in and registration

Kinde provides methods for easily implementing a login / register flow.

As an example if you add buttons as follows.

```jsx
<View>
  <View>
    <Button title="Sign In" onPress={handleSignIn} />
  </View>
  <View>
    <Button title="Sign Up" color="#000" onPress={handleSignUp} />
  </View>
</View>
```

Then define new functions that match for each button.

Note: Make sure you've already defined **KindeSDK** as **client** in the state.

```jsx
...
const handleSignUp = async () => {
  const token = await client.register();
  if (token) {
    // User was authenticated
  }
};

const handleSignIn = async () => {
  const token = await client.login();
  if (token) {
    // User was authenticated
  }
};
...

```

## **Log out**

This is implemented in much the same way as signing in or registering. The Kinde SPA client comes with a logout method:

```jsx
const handleLogout = async () => {
  const loggedOut = await client.logout();
  if (loggedOut) {
    // User was logged out
  }
};
```

We have also implemented an API for token revocation. Pass `true` as an argument in the `logout` function. This flag will assist in revoking the token without having to open the website within your apps.

```jsx
const handleLogout = async () => {
  const loggedOut = await client.logout(true);
  if (loggedOut) {
    // User was logged out
  }
};
```

**Note: Handle redirects are now deprecated**

Starting from version 1.1 of the SDK, the need to handle redirects has been eliminated. Authentication is now performed by launching a web browser within your app instead of relying on an external browser. For a comprehensive example of how to handle authentication, see below.

## **Full code sample for authentication**

```jsx
const checkAuthenticate = async () => {
  // Using `isAuthenticated` to check if the user is authenticated or not
  if (await client.isAuthenticated) {
    // Need to implement, e.g: call an api, etc...
  } else {
    // Need to implement, e.g: redirect user to sign in, etc..
  }
};

useEffect(() => {
  checkAuthenticate();
}, []);

const handleSignIn = async () => {
  const token = await client.login();

  if (token) {
    // Need to implement, e.g: call an api, etc...
  }
};

const handleSignUp = async () => {
  const token = await client.register();

  if (token) {
    // Need to implement, e.g: call an api, etc...
  }
};

const handleLogout = async () => {
  // With open web in your apps
  const isLoggedOut = await client.logout();

  if (isLoggedOut) {
    // Need to implement, e.g: redirect user to login screen, etc...
  }

  // Without open web in your apps
  const isLoggedOut = await client.logout();

  if (isLoggedOut) {
    // Need to implement, e.g: redirect user to login screen, etc...
  }
};
```

## **Get user information**

To access the user information, use the `getUserDetails` helper function.

```jsx
const userProfile = await client.getUserDetails();
console.log(userProfile);
// output: {"given_name":"Dave","id":"abcdef","family_name":"Smith","email":"dave@smith.com"}
```

## View users in Kinde

Go to the **Users** page within Kinde to see your newly registered user.

### User Permissions

Once a user has been verified, your product/application will return the JWT token with an array of permissions for that user. You will need to configure your product/application to read permissions and unlock the respective functions.

[Set permissions](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/user-permissions/) in your Kinde account. Here’s an example set of permissions.

```jsx
const permissions = [
  "create:todos",
  "update:todos",
  "read:todos",
  "delete:todos",
  "create:tasks",
  "update:tasks",
  "read:tasks",
  "delete:tasks"
];
```

We provide helper functions to more easily access permissions.

```jsx
await client.getPermission("create:todos");
// {orgCode: "org_1234", isGranted: true}

await client.getPermissions();
// {orgCode: "org_1234", permissions: ["create:todos", "update:todos", "read:todos"]}
```

A practical example in code might look something like.

```jsx
if ((await client.getPermission("create:todos")).isGranted) {
  // show Create Todo button in UI
}
```

## Audience

An audience is the intended recipient of an access token - for example the API for your application. The audience argument can be passed to the Kinde client to request an audience be added to the token.

The audience of a token is the intended recipient of the token.

```jsx
const client = new KindeSDK(
  YOUR_KINDE_ISSUER,
  YOUR_KINDE_REDIRECT_URI,
  YOUR_KINDE_CLIENT_ID,
  YOUR_KINDE_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI,
  YOUR_SCOPES,
  {
    audience: "api.yourapp.com"
  }
);
```

For details on how to connect, see [Register an API](/developer-tools/kinde-api/register-an-api/).

## Overriding scope

By default the `KindeSDK` requests the following scopes:

- profile
- email
- offline
- openid

You can override this by passing scope into the KindeSDK

```jsx
const client = new KindeSDK(
  YOUR_KINDE_ISSUER,
  YOUR_KINDE_REDIRECT_URI,
  YOUR_KINDE_CLIENT_ID,
  YOUR_KINDE_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI,
  "profile email offline openid"
);
```

## Getting claims

We have provided a helper to grab any claim from your id or access tokens. The helper defaults to access tokens:

```jsx
await client.getClaim("aud");
// ["api.yourapp.com"]

await client.getClaim("given_name", "id_token");
// "David"
```

## Organizations

For information about how organizations work in Kinde, see [Kinde organizations for developers](/build/organizations/orgs-for-developers/).

### Create an organization

To create a new organization within your application, you will need to run a similar function to this.

```jsx
<Button title="Create Organization" onPress={handleCreateOrg} />
```

Then define the function of the button.

Make sure you've already defined `KindeSDK` as the **client** in the state.

```jsx
const handleCreateOrg = () => {
  client.createOrg();
};

// You can also pass `org_name` as your organization
client.createOrg({org_name: "Your Organization"});
```

### Sign in and sign up to organizations

Kinde has a unique code for every organization. You’ll have to pass this code through when you register a new user.

Example function below:

```jsx
client.register({org_code: "your_org_code"});
```

If you want a user to sign in into a particular organization, pass this code along with the sign in method.

```jsx
client.login({org_code: "your_org_code"});
```

Following authentication, Kinde provides a json web token (jwt) to your application. Along with the standard information we also include the `org_code` and the permissions for that organization (this is important as a user can belong to multiple organizations and have different permissions for each). Example of a returned token:

Example of a returned token:

```jsx
{
    "aud": [],
    "exp": 1658475930,
    "iat": 1658472329,
    "iss": "https://your_subdomain.kinde.com",
    "jti": "123457890",
    "org_code": "org_1234",
    "permissions": ["read:todos", "create:todos"],
    "scp": ["openid", "profile", "email", "offline"],
    "sub": "kp:123457890"
}

```

The `id_token` will also contain an array of organizations that a user belongs to - this is useful if you wanted to build out an organization switcher for example.

```jsx
{
  ...
  "org_codes": ["org_1234", "org_4567"]
  ...
}

```

There are two helper functions you can use to extract information.

```jsx
await client.getOrganization();
// {orgCode: "org_1234"}

await client.getUserOrganizations();
// {orgCodes: ["org_1234", "org_abcd"]}
```

## Token Storage

Once the user has successfully authenticated, you'll have a JWT and a refresh token and that has been stored securely. E.g. using the `getAccessToken` method of the `Storage` class to get an access token.

```jsx
...
import { Storage } from '@kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-7x'
...

const accessToken = await Storage.getAccessToken();
console.log('access_token', accessToken);

```

We're using the [expo-secure-store](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-secure-store) for `Expo`.

The storage handler can be found at: [Storage class](https://github.com/kinde-oss/kinde-react-native-sdk-0-7x/blob/main/dist/SDK/Storage/index.d.ts)

## **How to test**

Run the test suite using the following command at the root of your React Native.

```shell
npm run test

```

Note: Ensure you have already run `npm install`

## General tips

### **Building Issues**

- **`'value'`** **is unavailable: introduced in iOS 12.0**

  If you got the error **'value' is unavailable: introduced in iOS 12.0** when trying to build the app, you can follow the below steps to fix that:

  1.  In your Xcode project navigator, select **Pods.**
  2.  Under Targets, select **React-Codegen**.
  3.  Select the **Build Settings** tab**.**
  4.  Under **Deployment**, set **iOS Deployment Target** to **12.4.**
  5.  Clean project and rebuild: **Product > Clean Build Folder, Product > Build.**

    alt=""
    width="672px"
    height="auto"
    fetchpriority="low"
    loading="lazy"
    decoding="async"
  />

- Dependency `'androidx.browser:browser:1.6.0-beta01'` requires libraries and applications that depend on it to compile against version 34 or later of the Android APIs.

  The solution is add `androidXBrowser = "1.4.0"` in your project.

  ```java
  // android/build.gradle
  buildscript {
      ...

- Duplicate class **kotlin.collections.jdk8.CollectionsJDK8Kt** found in modules **jetified-kotlin-stdlib-1.8.10** (org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:1.8.10) and **jetified-kotlin-stdlib-jdk8-1.7.22** (org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk8:1.7.22)

  The solution is add `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-bom:1.8.0` dependency in your project.

  ```text
  // android/app/build.grade
  dependencies {
      ...
      implementation(platform("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-bom:1.8.0"))
      ...
  }

### **Caching Issues**

Sometimes there will be issues related to caching when you develop React Native.
There are some recommendations for cleaning the cache:

1. Remove `node_modules`, `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json`.
2. Clean cache: `yarn cache clean` or `npm cache clean --force`.
3. Make sure you have changed values in `.env` file.
4. Trying to install packages again: `yarn install` or `npm install`.
5. Run Metro Bundler: `yarn start --reset-cache` or `npm start --reset-cache`.

Assume your StarterKit path is `<StarterKit_PATH>`.

**Clean cache for Android**

1. Run this:

   ```shell
   cd <StarterKit_PATH>/android
   ./gradlew clean

   ```

**Clean cache for iOS**

1. Run this:

   ```shell
   cd <StarterKit_PATH>/ios
   rm -rf Pods && rm Podfile.lock

   ```

2. Clean build folders on **Xcode**.
