The Kinde React Native SDK allows developers to quickly and securely integrate a new or an existing React Native application into the Kinde platform.

## Supported versions

### React Native SDK 0.6x

**`Kinde React Native SDK 0.6x`** is compatible with React Native versions 0.60 to 0.69.

- GitHub: [kinde-react-native-sdk-0-6x](https://github.com/kinde-oss/kinde-react-native-sdk-0-6x)
- NPM: [@kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-6x](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-6x)

### React Native SDK 0.7x

**`Kinde React Native SDK 0.7x`** is compatible with React Native versions 0.70 or higher.

- GitHub: [kinde-react-native-sdk-0-7x](https://github.com/kinde-oss/kinde-react-native-sdk-0-7x)
- NPM: [@kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-7x](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-7x)

### Expo

**`Kinde React Native SDK 0.6x`** and **`Kinde React Native SDK 0.7x`** are designed to work well with Expo. You can easily incorporate them into your Expo projects by following the instructions provided in the [Expo and React Native SDK documentation](/developer-tools/sdks/native/expo/).

Compatible versions:

- Expo SDK version 46.0.0: Use [Kinde React Native SDK 0.6x](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-6x)
- Expo SDK version 47.0.0 or higher: Use [Kinde React Native SDK 0.7x](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-7x)

You can also check out our starter kits on GitHub:

- [Starter kit for Kinde React Native SDK 0.6x](https://github.com/kinde-starter-kits/kinde-react-native-starter-kit-0-6x)
- [Starter kit for Kinde React Native SDK 0.7x](https://github.com/kinde-starter-kits/kinde-react-native-starter-kit-0-7x)

## Before you begin

- If you haven’t already got a Kinde account, [register for free here](https://app.kinde.com/register) (no credit card required). Registering gives you a Kinde domain, which you need to get started, e.g. `yourapp.kinde.com`.
- You will also need Node, the React Native command line interface, a JDK, Android Studio (for Android) and Xcode (for iOS).
- Follow [the installation instructions for your chosen OS](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to install dependencies.

<Aside type="warning" title="Important">

Fundamentally, both SDK versions have equivalent functionality, so there should be no issue integrating either of them. In this guide, we use examples from version 0.7x. But version 0.6x is identical in terms of integration and application.

</Aside>

## **Installation**

<PackageManagers pkg="@kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-7x" />

### **Android**

The SDK requires the `react-native-keychain` and `react-native-inappbrowser-reborn` packages. Sometimes, they may not be automatically linked correctly, resulting in errors when running your app, such as `"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'isAvailable')"`. In such cases, you will need to manually link them:

1. Edit `android/settings.gradle`

   ```java
   include ':react-native-keychain'
   project(':react-native-keychain').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-keychain/android')

   include ':react-native-inappbrowser-reborn'
   project(':react-native-inappbrowser-reborn').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-inappbrowser-reborn/android')
   ```

2. Edit `android/app/build.gradle`

   ```java
   apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

   android {
     ...
   }

   dependencies {
     ...

     implementation project(':react-native-keychain')
   	implementation project(':react-native-inappbrowser-reborn')

     ...
   }
   ```

3. Edit `MainApplication.java`

   ```java
   import com.oblador.keychain.KeychainPackage;
   import com.proyecto26.inappbrowser.RNInAppBrowserPackage;
   ...

   public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {
       private final ReactNativeHost mReactNativeHost =
         new ReactNativeHost(this) {
           ...
           @Override
           protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
   					...
             List<ReactPackage> packages = new PackageList(this).getPackages();
             packages.add(new KeychainPackage());
             packages.add(new RNInAppBrowserPackage());
   					...
             return packages;
           }
           ...
         };

     ...
   }
   ```

In React Native version 0.73 or above, the `MainApplication.java` file has been replaced with `MainApplication.kt`

```kotlin
import com.oblador.keychain.KeychainPackage;
import com.proyecto26.inappbrowser.RNInAppBrowserPackage;
...

class MainApplication : Application(), ReactApplication {
    override val reactNativeHost: ReactNativeHost =
      object : DefaultReactNativeHost(this) {
        override fun getPackages(): List<ReactPackage> =
            PackageList(this).packages.apply {
              // Packages that cannot be autolinked yet can be added manually here, for example:
              // add(MyReactNativePackage())
              add(KeychainPackage());
              add(RNInAppBrowserPackage());
            }

        ...
      }

  ...
}
```

### **iOS**

To update iOS native dependencies, you can use **CocoaPods**. We recommend installing **CocoaPods** using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```shell
brew install cocoapods

cd ios && pod install
```

The SDK requires the `react-native-keychain` and `react-native-inappbrowser-reborn` packages. Sometimes, they may not be automatically linked correctly, resulting in errors when running your app, such as `"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'isAvailable')"`. In such cases, you will need to manually link them:

1. **Option: With CocoaPods (Highly recommended)**

   Please add the following lines to your **Podfile**, and then run `pod update`:

   ```swift
   pod 'RNKeychain', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-keychain'
   pod 'RNInAppBrowser', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-inappbrowser-reborn'
   ```

2. **Option: Manually link the packages with Xcode**
   - Go to the **Build Phases** tab and choose **Link Binary With Libraries.**
   - Select **+**
   - Add **Other** > **Add Files** > **node_modules/react-native-keychain/RNKeychain.xcodeproj** (similar with **RNInAppBrowser**)
   - Add **libRNKeychain.a** (similar with **RNInAppBrowser**)
   - Clean and rebuild.

If you encounter any errors during the SDK installation process, you can refer to the General Tips section at the end of this topic.

## K**inde configuration**

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Applications.**
2. Select **View details** on the **Front-end app**.
3. Scroll down to the **Callback URLs** section.
4. Add in the callback URLs for your React Native app, which should look something like this:
   - Allowed callback URLs - `myapp://myhost.kinde.com/kinde_callback`
   - Allowed logout redirect URLs - `myapp://myhost.kinde.com/kinde_callback`

Make sure you press the Save button at the bottom of the page!

Note: The `myapp://myhost.kinde.com/kinde_callback` is used as an example of local URL Scheme, change to the local local URL Scheme that you use.

## Environments

If you would like to use our Environments feature as part of your development process. You will need to create them first within your Kinde account. In this case you would use the Environment subdomain in the code block above.

## Configure your app

### **Environment variables**

Put these variables in your .env file. You can find these variables on the same page as where you set the callback URLs.

- `KINDE_ISSUER_URL` - your Kinde domain
- `KINDE_POST_CALLBACK_URL` - After the user authenticates we will callback to this address. Make sure this URL is under your allowed callback URLs
- `KINDE_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL` - where you want users to be redirected to after logging out. Make sure this URL is under your allowed logout redirect URLs
- `KINDE_CLIENT_ID` - you can find this on the App Keys page

```typescript
KINDE_ISSUER_URL=https://your_kinde_domain.kinde.com
KINDE_POST_CALLBACK_URL=myapp://your_kinde_domain.kinde.com/kinde_callback
KINDE_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL=myapp://your_kinde_domain.kinde.com/kinde_callback
KINDE_CLIENT_ID=your_kinde_client_id
```

Configuration example:

```typescript
KINDE_ISSUER_URL=https://myhost.kinde.com
KINDE_POST_CALLBACK_URL=myapp://myhost.kinde.com/kinde_callback
KINDE_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL=myapp://myhost.kinde.com/kinde_callback
KINDE_CLIENT_ID=myclient@live
```

## Configuration deep link

### **Android**

Open `AndroidManifest.xml` and update your scheme by adding a new block in activity.

```xml
<intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    <data android:scheme="myapp" android:host="your_kinde_host" />  // Please modify sheme and host to reflect your preferences.
</intent-filter>
```

### **iOS**

You need to link `RCTLinking` to your project using the steps below.

1. If you also want to listen to incoming app links during your app's execution, add the following lines to your `AppDelegate.m`.

   ```swift
   // iOS 9.x or newer
   #import <React/RCTLinkingManager.h>
   - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
      openURL:(NSURL *)url
      options:(NSDictionary<UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey,id> *)options
   {
     return [RCTLinkingManager application:application openURL:url options:options];
   }
   ```

2. If you're targeting iOS 8.x or older, use the following code instead.

   ```swift
   // iOS 8.x or older
   #import <React/RCTLinkingManager.h>
   - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url
     sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation
   {
     return [RCTLinkingManager application:application openURL:url
                         sourceApplication:sourceApplication annotation:annotation];
   }
   ```

3. Make sure you have a configuration URL scheme in `Info.plist`, so the app can be opened by deep link.

   ```swift
   <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
   <array>
     <dict>
       <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
       <string>Editor</string>
       <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
       <string>myapp</string> // you can change it
       <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
       <array>
         <string>myapp</string> // you can change it
       </array>
     </dict>
   </arra
   ```

## Integrate with your app

To create a new instance of the KindeSDK object, execute the code below.

```typescript
import { KindeSDK } from '@kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-7x';
...

...
const client = new KindeSDK(YOUR_KINDE_ISSUER, YOUR_KINDE_REDIRECT_URI, YOUR_KINDE_CLIENT_ID, YOUR_KINDE_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI);
```

## Sign in and registration

Kinde provides methods for easily implementing a login / register flow. You can add buttons as follows.

```typescript
<View>
    <View>
        <Button title="Sign In" onPress={handleSignIn} />
    </View>
    <View>
        <Button title="Sign Up" color="#000" onPress={handleSignUp} />
    </View>
</View>
```

Then define new functions that match for each button.

**Note**: Before proceeding, make sure you’ve defined the **KindeSDK** as a **client** variable.

```typescript
...
const handleSignUp = async () => {
  const token = await client.register();
  if (token) {
    // User was authenticated
  }
};

const handleSignIn = async () => {
  const token = await client.login();
  if (token) {
    // User was authenticated
  }
};
...
```

## **Log out**

This is implemented in much the same way as signing in or registering. The Kinde SPA client comes with a logout method:

```typescript
const handleLogout = async () => {
  const loggedOut = await client.logout();
  if (loggedOut) {
    // User was logged out
  }
};
```

We have also implemented an API for token revocation. Pass `true` as an argument in the `logout` function. This flag will assist in revoking the token without having to open the website within your apps.

```typescript
const handleLogout = async () => {
  const loggedOut = await client.logout(true);
  if (loggedOut) {
    // User was logged out
  }
};
```

**Note: Handle redirects are now deprecated**

Starting from version 1.1 of the SDK, the need to handle redirects has been eliminated. Authentication is now performed by launching a web browser within your app instead of relying on an external browser. For a comprehensive example of how to handle authentication, see below.

## **Full code sample for authentication**

```typescript
const checkAuthenticate = async () => {
  // Using `isAuthenticated` to check if the user is authenticated or not
  if (await client.isAuthenticated) {
    // Need to implement, e.g: call an api, etc...
  } else {
    // Need to implement, e.g: redirect user to sign in, etc..
  }
};

useEffect(() => {
  checkAuthenticate();
}, []);

const handleSignIn = async () => {
  const token = await client.login();

  if (token) {
    // Need to implement, e.g: call an api, etc...
  }
};

const handleSignUp = async () => {
  const token = await client.register();

  if (token) {
    // Need to implement, e.g: call an api, etc...
  }
};

const handleLogout = async () => {
  // With open web in your apps
  const isLoggedOut = await client.logout();

  if (isLoggedOut) {
    // Need to implement, e.g: redirect user to login screen, etc...
  }

  // Without open web in your apps
  const isLoggedOut = await client.logout();

  if (isLoggedOut) {
    // Need to implement, e.g: redirect user to login screen, etc...
  }
};
```

## **Get user information**

To access the user information, use the `getUserDetails` helper function.

```typescript
const userProfile = await client.getUserDetails();
console.log(userProfile);
// output: {"given_name":"Dave","id":"abcdef","family_name":"Smith","email":"dave@smith.com"}
```

## View users in Kinde

Go to the Users page in Kinde to see your newly registered user.

### User Permissions

Once a user has been verified, your product/application will return the JWT token with an array of permissions for that user. You will need to configure your product/application to read permissions and unlock the respective functions.

[Set permissions](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/user-permissions/) in your Kinde account. Here’s an example set of permissions.

```typescript
const permissions = [
  "create:todos",
  "update:todos",
  "read:todos",
  "delete:todos",
  "create:tasks",
  "update:tasks",
  "read:tasks",
  "delete:tasks"
];
```

We provide helper functions to more easily access permissions.

```typescript
await client.getPermission("create:todos");
// {orgCode: "org_1234", isGranted: true}

await client.getPermissions();
// {orgCode: "org_1234", permissions: ["create:todos", "update:todos", "read:todos"]}
```

A practical example in code might look something like.

```typescript
if ((await client.getPermission("create:todos")).isGranted) {
  // show Create Todo button in UI
}
```

## Audience

An audience is the intended recipient of an access token - for example the API for your application. The audience argument can be passed to the Kinde client to request an audience be added to the token.

The audience of a token is the intended recipient of the token.

```typescript
const client = new KindeSDK(
  YOUR_KINDE_ISSUER,
  YOUR_KINDE_REDIRECT_URI,
  YOUR_KINDE_CLIENT_ID,
  YOUR_KINDE_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI,
  YOUR_SCOPES,
  {
    audience: "api.yourapp.com"
  }
);
```

For details on how to connect, see [Register an API](/developer-tools/your-apis/register-manage-apis/).

## Overriding scope

By default the `KindeSDK` requests the following scopes:

- profile
- email
- offline
- openid

You can override this by passing scope into the KindeSDK.

```typescript
const client = new KindeSDK(
  YOUR_KINDE_ISSUER,
  YOUR_KINDE_REDIRECT_URI,
  YOUR_KINDE_CLIENT_ID,
  YOUR_KINDE_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI,
  "profile email offline openid"
);
```

## Getting claims

We have provided a helper to grab any claim from your id or access tokens. The helper defaults to access tokens:

```typescript
await client.getClaim("aud");
// { name: "aud", value ["api.yourapp.com"] }

await client.getClaim("given_name", "id_token");
// { name: "given_name", value: "David" }
```

## Organizations

### Create an organization

To create a new organization within your application, you will need to run a similar function to this.

```typescript
<Button title="Create Organization" onPress={handleCreateOrg} />
```

Then define the function of the button.

Make sure you've already defined `KindeSDK` as the **client** in the state.

```typescript
const handleCreateOrg = () => {
  client.createOrg();
};

// You can also pass `org_name` as your organization
client.createOrg({org_name: "Your Organization"});
```

### Sign in and sign up to organizations

Kinde has a unique code for every organization. You’ll have to pass this code through when you register a new user.

Example function below:

```typescript
client.register({orgCode: "your_org_code"});
```

If you want a user to sign in into a particular organization, pass this code along with the sign in method.

```typescript
client.login({orgCode: "your_org_code"});
```

Following authentication, Kinde provides a json web token (jwt) to your application. Along with the standard information we also include the `org_code` and the permissions for that organization (this is important as a user can belong to multiple organizations and have different permissions for each). Example of a returned token:

Example of a returned token:

```typescript
{
    "aud": [],
    "exp": 1658475930,
    "iat": 1658472329,
    "iss": "https://your_subdomain.kinde.com",
    "jti": "123457890",
    "org_code": "org_1234",
    "permissions": ["read:todos", "create:todos"],
    "scp": ["openid", "profile", "email", "offline"],
    "sub": "kp:123457890"
}
```

The `id_token` will also contain an array of organizations that a user belongs to - this is useful if you wanted to build out an organization switcher for example.

```typescript
{
  ...
  "org_codes": ["org_1234", "org_4567"]
  ...
}
```

There are two helper functions you can use to extract information.

```typescript
await client.getOrganization();
// {orgCode: "org_1234"}

await client.getUserOrganizations();
// {orgCodes: ["org_1234", "org_abcd"]}
```

For more information about how organizations work in Kinde, see [Kinde organizations for developers](/build/organizations/orgs-for-developers/).

## **Feature Flags**

We have provided a helper to return any features flag from the access token:

```typescript
client.getFlag('theme')
// returns
{
		"is_default": false
  	"value": "pink",
  	"code": "theme",
  	"type": "string",
}

client.getFlag('no-feature-flag')
// Error: This flag 'no-feature-flag' was not found, and no default value has been provided

client.getFlag('no-feature-flag', 'default-value')
// returns
{
		"is_default": true
		"code": "no-feature-flag",
		"value": "default-value",
}

client.getFlag('theme', 'default-theme', 'b')
// Error: Flag 'theme' is type string - requested type boolean
```

We also require wrapper functions by type which should leverage `getFlag` above.

### **Get boolean flags**

```typescript
/**
 * Get a boolean flag from the feature_flags claim of the access_token.
 * @param {String} code - The name of the flag.
 * @param {Boolean} [defaultValue] - A fallback value if the flag isn't found.
 * @return {Boolean}
 */
kindeClient.getBooleanFlag(code, defaultValue);

kindeClient.getBooleanFlag("is_dark_mode");
// true

kindeClient.getBooleanFlag("is_dark_mode", false);
// true

kindeClient.getBooleanFlag("new_feature");
// Error: This flag 'new_feature' was not found, and no default value has been provided

kindeClient.getBooleanFlag("new_feature", false);
// false (flag does not exist so falls back to default)

kindeClient.getBooleanFlag("theme", "blue");
// Error: Flag 'theme' is type string - requested type boolean
```

### Get string flags

```typescript
/**
 * Get a string flag from the feature_flags claim of the access_token.
 * @param {String} code - The name of the flag.
 * @param {String} [defaultValue] - A fallback value if the flag isn't found.
 * @return {String}
 */
kindeClient.getStringFlag(code, defaultValue);

/* Example usage */
kindeClient.getStringFlag("theme");
// pink

kindeClient.getStringFlag("theme", "black");
// true

kindeClient.getStringFlag("cta_color");
// Error: This flag 'cta_color' was not found, and no default value has been provided

kindeClient.getStringFlag("cta_color", "blue");
// blue (flag does not exist so falls back to default)

kindeClient.getStringFlag("is_dark_mode", false);
// Error: Flag 'is_dark_mode' is type string - requested type boolean
```

### **Get integer flags**

```typescript
/**
 * Get an integer flag from the feature_flags claim of the access_token.
 * @param {String} code - The name of the flag.
 * @param {Integer} [defaultValue] - A fallback value if the flag isn't found.
 * @return {Integer}
 */
kindeClient.getIntegerFlag(code, defaultValue);

kindeClient.getIntegerFlag("competitions_limit");
// 5

kindeClient.getIntegerFlag("competitions_limit", 3);
// 5

kindeClient.getIntegerFlag("team_count");
// Error: This flag 'team_count' was not found, and no default value has been provided

kindeClient.getIntegerFlag("team_count", 2);
// 2 (flag does not exist so falls back to default)

kindeClient.getIntegerFlag("is_dark_mode", false);
// Error: Flag 'is_dark_mode' is type boolean - requested type integer+
```

## Token Storage

Once the user has successfully authenticated, you'll have a JWT and a refresh token and that has been stored securely. E.g. using the `getAccessToken` method of the `Storage` class to get an access token.

```typescript
...
import { Storage } from '@kinde-oss/react-native-sdk-0-7x'
...

const accessToken = await Storage.getAccessToken();
console.log('access_token', accessToken);
```

We're using the [react-native-keychain](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-keychain) for `React Native`

The storage handler can be found at: [Storage class](https://github.com/kinde-oss/kinde-react-native-sdk-0-7x/blob/main/dist/SDK/Storage/index.d.ts)

## **How to test**

Run the test suite using the following command at the root of your React Native.

```shell
npm run test
```

Note: Ensure you have already run `npm install`.

## General tips

### **Building issues**

**`'value'`** **is unavailable: introduced in iOS 12.0**

If you got the error **'value' is unavailable: introduced in iOS 12.0** when trying to build the app, you can follow the below steps to fix that:

1. In your Xcode project navigator, select **Pods.**
2. Under Targets, select **React-Codegen**.
3. Select the **Build Settings** tab.
4. Under **Deployment**, set **iOS Deployment Target** to **12.4.**
5. Clean project and rebuild: **Product > Clean Build Folder, Product > Build.**

  width="672px"
  height="auto"
  fetchpriority="low"
  loading="lazy"
  decoding="async"
/>

6. Dependency `'androidx.browser:browser:1.6.0-beta01'` requires libraries and applications that depend on it to compile against version 34 or later of the Android APIs

   The solution is add `androidXBrowser = "1.4.0"` in your project.

   ```java
   // android/build.gradle
   buildscript {
       ...
       ext {
           // ...
           androidXBrowser = "1.4.0"
           // ....
       }
       ...
   }
   ```

7. Duplicate class **kotlin.collections.jdk8.CollectionsJDK8Kt** found in modules **jetified-kotlin-stdlib-1.8.10** (org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:1.8.10) and **jetified-kotlin-stdlib-jdk8-1.7.22** (org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk8:1.7.22)

   The solution is add `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-bom:1.8.0` dependency in your project.

   ```java
   // android/app/build.grade
   dependencies {
       ...
       implementation(platform("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-bom:1.8.0"))
       ...
   }


   ```

### **Caching issues**

Sometimes there will be issues related to caching when you develop React Native.
There are some recommendations for cleaning the cache:

1. Remove `node_modules`, `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json`.
2. Clean cache: `yarn cache clean` or `npm cache clean --force`.
3. Make sure you have changed values in `.env` file.
4. Trying to install packages again: `yarn install` or `npm install`.
5. Run Metro Bundler: `yarn start --reset-cache` or `npm start --reset-cache`.

Assume your StarterKit path is `<StarterKit_PATH>`.

**Clean cache for Android**

- Run this:

  ```shell
  cd <StarterKit_PATH>/android
  ./gradlew clean

  ```

**Clean cache for iOS**

1. Run this:

   ```shell
   cd <StarterKit_PATH>/ios
   rm -rf Pods && rm Podfile.lock

   ```

2. Clean build folders on **Xcode**.
