If you haven’t already got a Kinde account, [register for free here](https://app.kinde.com/register) (no credit card required). This will give you a Kinde domain, which you need to get started, e.g. `yourapp.kinde.com`

You can also view the [JavaScript starter kit](https://github.com/kinde-starter-kits/javascript-starter-kit) in GitHub.

## **Set up Kinde**

### **Set your callback and logout URLs**

Kinde will redirect your user to authenticate. They’ll be redirected back to your JavaScript app after signing in or signing up.

To authenticate your app, you need to specify which URL Kinde should redirect your user. These need to match the ones listed in your application details in Kinde.

The `http://localhost:3000` is an example of a commonly used local development URL. It should be replaced with the URL where your app is running.

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Applications > [your app] > View details**.
2. Set the **Allowed callback URLs** (also known as redirect URIs) to the URL of your app. This is where the Kinde client app is served. For local development this could be `http://localhost:3000`. This is required for your users to sign in to your app successfully.
3. Set the URLs they’ll be redirected to after signing out, by adding **Allowed logout redirect URLs** to your JavaScript applications logout page. For local development this could be `http://localhost:3000`.
4. Select **Save**.

### **Environments**

As part of your development process, we highly recommend you create a development environment within your Kinde account. In this case, you’d use the Environment subdomain in the code block above.

## **Set up your app**

### Installation

<PackageManagers pkg="@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-pkce-js" />

### **Integrate with your app**

You’ll need to create a new instance of the Kinde Auth client object.

We recommend using the async/await method. It must be the first thing that happens before you initialize your app.

```jsx
import createKindeClient from "@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-pkce-js";

(async () => {
	const kinde = await createKindeClient({
		client_id: <your_kinde_client_id>,
		domain: "https://<your_kinde_subdomain>.kinde.com",
		redirect_uri: window.location.origin
	});
}

```

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Applications > [your app] > View details**.
2. Replace the **client_id** and **domain** placeholders in the code block above with the the values from the **App keys** section.

Note: The `redirect_uri` value you enter here needs to be the same as the redirect URI you entered in the Kinde application (see above).

## Log in / register

Kinde provides login / register methods that are easy to implement. Here’s an example of adding buttons to your HTML:

```html
<div id="logged_out_view">
  <button id="login" type="button">Sign in</button>
  <button id="register" type="button">Register</button>
</div>
```

You can bind events to buttons.

```jsx
document.getElementById("login").addEventListener("click", async () => {
  await kinde.login();
});

document.getElementById("register").addEventListener("click", async () => {
  await kinde.register();
});
```

Clicking either of these buttons redirects your user to Kinde, where they authenticate before being redirected back to your site.

### **Test sign up**

Register your first user by signing up yourself. You’ll see your newly registered user on the **Users** page of the relevant organization in Kinde.

## **Handle redirect**

Once your user is redirected back to your site from Kinde, you can set a callback to take place. The callback automatically passes in the user object and any application state you set prior to the redirect.

```jsx
on_redirect_callback: (user, appState) => {
  console.log({user, appState});
  if (user) {
    // render logged in view
  } else {
    // render logged out view
  }
};
```

## Log out

This is implemented in much the same way as signing in or registering. The Kinde single page application client already comes with a sign out method.

```jsx
document.getElementById("logout").addEventListener("click", async () => {
  await kinde.logout();
});
```

## **Call your API**

The `getToken` method lets you to securely call your API and pass the bearer token to validate that your user is authenticated.

```jsx
(async () => {
  try {
    const token = await kinde.getToken();
    const response = await fetch(YOUR_API, {
      headers: new Headers({
        Authorization: "Bearer " + token
      })
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log({data});
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
})();
```

We recommend using our middleware on your back end to verify users and protect endpoints. Our current implementation is Node/Express, but we’re working on more.

## **Organizations**

For general information about using organizations, see [Kinde organizations for developers](/build/organizations/orgs-for-developers/).

**Create an organization**

To create a new organization within your application, you will need to run a similar function below.

```jsx
document.getElementById("createOrganization").addEventListener("click", async () => await kinde.createOrg();});
```

**Sign up / sign in users to organizations**

Kinde has a unique code for every organization. You’ll have to pass this code through when you register a new user. Example function below:

```jsx
kinde.register({org_code: ‘org_1234’});
```

If you want a user to sign into a particular organization, pass this code along with the sign in method.

```jsx
kinde.login({org_code: ‘org_1234’});
```

Following authentication, Kinde provides a json web token (jwt) to your application. Along with the standard information we also include the `org_code` and the `permissions` for that organization (this is important as a user can belong to multiple organizations and have different permissions for each). Example of a returned token:

```json
{
	"aud": [],
	"exp": 1658475930,
	"iat": 1658472329,
	"iss": "https://your_subdomain.kinde.com",
	"jti": "123457890",
	"org_code": "org_1234",
	"permissions": [“read:todos”, “create:todos”],
	"scp": [
		"openid",
		"profile",
		"email",
		"offline"
	],
	"sub": "kp:123457890"
}
```

The `id_token` will also contain an array of Organizations that a user belongs to - this is useful if you wanted to build out an organization switcher for example.

```json
{
...
"org_codes": ["org_1234", "org_4567"]
...
}
```

There are two helper functions you can use to extract information:

```jsx
kinde.getOrganization();
// {orgCode: "org_1234"}

kinde.getUserOrganizations();
// {orgCodes: ["org_1234", "org_abcd"]}
```

## **Get user information**

Use the `getUser()` helper function to request the user information from Kinde.

Use the `getUserProfile()` function to request the latest user information from the server.

```jsx
const user = kinde.getUser();
const user = await kinde.getUserProfile();
// user will be populated with a user object
{
	id: "kp_0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
	given_name: "Billy",
	family_name: "Hoyle",
	email: "billy@example.com",
	picture: "https://link_to_avatar_url.kinde.com"
}
```

## **User permissions**

When a user signs in to an organization the Access token your product/application receives contains a custom claim with an array of permissions for that user.

You can set permissions in your Kinde account. Here’s an example.

```json
"permissions":[
	"create:todos",
	"update:todos",
	"read:todos",
	"delete:todos",
	"create:tasks",
	"update:tasks",
	"read:tasks",
	"delete:tasks",
]
```

We provide helper functions to more easily access permissions:

```jsx
kinde.getPermission("create:todos");
// {orgCode: "org_1234", isGranted: true}

kinde.getPermissions();
// {orgCode: "org_1234", permissions: ["create:todos", "update:todos", "read:todos"]}
```

A practical example in code might look something like:

```jsx
if (kinde.getPermission("create:todos").isGranted) {
  // show Create Todo button in UI
}
```

## **Feature flags**

When a user signs in the Access token your product/application receives contains a custom claim called `feature_flags` which is an object detailing the feature flags for that user.

You can set feature flags in your Kinde account. Here’s an example.

```jsx
feature_flags: {
  theme: {
      "t": "s",
      "v": "pink"
 },
 is_dark_mode: {
      "t": "b",
      "v": true
  },
 competitions_limit: {
      "t": "i",
      "v": 5
  }
}
```

In order to minimize the payload in the token we have used single letter keys / values where possible. The single letters represent the following:

`t` = `type`

`v` = `value`

`s` = `string`

`b` = `boolean`

`i` = `integer`

We provide helper functions to more easily access feature flags:

```jsx
/**
  * Get a flag from the feature_flags claim of the access_token.
  * @param {string} code - The name of the flag.
  * @param {obj} [defaultValue] - A fallback value if the flag isn't found.
  * @param {'s'|'b'|'i'|undefined} [flagType] - The data type of the flag (integer / boolean / string).
  * @return {object} Flag details.
*/
kinde.getFlag(code, defaultValue, flagType);

/* Example usage */

kinde.getFlag('theme');
/*{
//   "code": "theme",
//   "type": "string",
//   "value": "pink",
//   "is_default": false // whether the fallback value had to be used
*/}

kinde.getFlag('create_competition', {defaultValue: false});
/*{
      "code": "create_competition",
      "value": false,
      "is_default": true // because fallback value had to be used
}*/
```

We also require wrapper functions by type which should leverage `getFlag` above.

Booleans:

```jsx
/**
 * Get a boolean flag from the feature_flags claim of the access_token.
 * @param {string} code - The name of the flag.
 * @param {bool} [defaultValue] - A fallback value if the flag isn't found.
 * @return {bool}
 */
kinde.getBooleanFlag(code, defaultValue);

/* Example usage */
kinde.getBooleanFlag("is_dark_mode");
// true

kinde.getBooleanFlag("is_dark_mode", false);
// true

kinde.getBooleanFlag("new_feature", false);
// false (flag does not exist so falls back to default)
```

Strings and integers work in the same way as booleans above:

```jsx
/**
 * Get a string flag from the feature_flags claim of the access_token.
 * @param {string} code - The name of the flag.
 * @param {string} [defaultValue] - A fallback value if the flag isn't found.
 * @return {string}
 */ getStringFlag(code, defaultValue);

/**
 * Get an integer flag from the feature_flags claim of the access_token.
 * @param {string} code - The name of the flag.
 * @param {int} [defaultValue] - A fallback value if the flag isn't found.
 * @return {int}
 */ getIntegerFlag(code, defaultValue);
```

## **Audience**

An `audience` is the intended recipient of an access token - for example the API for your application. The audience argument can be passed to the Kinde client to request an audience be added to the provided token.

The audience of a token is the intended recipient of the token.

```jsx
const kinde = await createKindeClient({
  audience: "<your_api>"
  ...
});
```

To request multiple audiences, pass them separated by white space. See example.

```jsx
const kinde = await createKindeClient({
  audience: "<your_api1> <your_api2"
	...
});
```

For details on how to connect, see [Register an API](/developer-tools/your-apis/register-manage-apis/).

## **Overriding scope**

By default the JavaScript SDK requests the following scopes:

- `profile`
- `email`
- `offline`
- `openid`

You can override this by passing `scope` into the `createKindeClient`

```jsx
const kinde = await createKindeClient({
  client_id: "<your_kinde_client_id>",
  domain: "https://<your_kinde_subdomain>.kinde.com",
  redirect_uri: "http://localhost:3000",
  scope: "openid"
});
```

## **Getting claims**

We have provided a helper to grab any claim from your id or access tokens. The helper defaults to access tokens:

```jsx
kinde.getClaim("aud");
// {name: "aud", "value": ["api.yourapp.com"]}

kinde.getClaim("given_name", "id_token");
// {name: "given_name", "value": "David"}
```

## **Persisting authentication state on page refresh or new tab**

You will find that when you refresh the browser using a front-end based SDK that the authentication state is lost. This is because there is no secure way to persist this in the front-end.

There are two ways to work around this.

- (Recommended) use our [Custom Domains](/build/domains/pointing-your-domain/) feature which then allows us to set a secure, httpOnly first party cookie on your domain.
- (Non-production solution only) If you’re not yet ready to add your custom domain, or for local development, we offer an escape hatch you can provide to the Kinde Client `is_dangerously_use_local_storage`. This will use local storage to store the refresh token. DO NOT use this in production.

Once you implement one of the above, you don’t need to do anything else.

## **Persisting application state**

The options argument passed into the `login` and `register` methods accepts an `app_state` key where you can pass in the current application state prior to redirecting to Kinde. This is then returned to you in the second argument of the `on_redirect_callback` as seen above.

A common use case is to allow redirects to the page the user was trying to access prior to authentication. This could be achieved as follows:

Login handler:

```jsx
login({
  app_state: {
    redirectTo: window.location
  }
});
```

Redirect handler:

```jsx
const kinde = await createKindeClient({
  client_id: "<your_kinde_client_id>",
  domain: "https://<your_kinde_subdomain>.kinde.com",
  redirect_uri: "http://localhost:3000",
  on_redirect_callback: (user, appState) => {
    if (appState?.redirectTo) {
      window.location = appState?.redirectTo;
    }
  }
});
```

## **Token storage in the authentication state**

By default the JWTs provided by Kinde are stored in memory. This protects you from both [CSRF](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf) attacks (possible if stored as a client side cookie) and [XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) attacks (possible if persisted in local storage).

The trade off with this approach however is that if a page is refreshed or a new tab is opened then the token is wiped from memory, and the sign in button would need to be clicked to re-authenticate. There are two ways to prevent this behaviour:

1. Use the Kinde custom domain feature. We can then set a secure, httpOnly cookie against your domain containing only the refresh token which is not vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
2. There is an escape hatch which can be used for local development: `is_dangerously_use_local_storage`. This absolutely should not be used in production and we highly recommend you use a custom domain. This will store only the refresh token in local storage and is used to silently re-authenticate.

```jsx
const kinde = await createKindeClient({
  client_id: "[YOUR_KINDE_CLIENT_ID]",
  domain: "[YOUR_KINDE_DOMAIN]",
  redirect_uri: window.location.origin,
  is_dangerously_use_local_storage: true
});
```
