If you haven’t already got a Kinde account, [register for free here](https://app.kinde.com/register) (no credit card required). Registering gives you a Kinde domain, which you need to get started, e.g. `yourapp.kinde.com`.

This topic assumes you are building with ExpressJS and have the relevant `express` packages already installed.

You can view Kinde’s [Express JS docs](https://github.com/kinde-oss/kinde-node-express) and [Express JS starter kit](https://github.com/kinde-starter-kits/expressjs-starter-kit) in GitHub.

## Set up your app

### Add Kinde ExpressJS SDK as a dependency

Node version 18.x.x or newer.

<PackageManagers pkg="@kinde-oss/kinde-node-express" />

### Integrate with your app

You’ll need to import our Kinde helpers into your project. We recommend you do this in the entry point of your application, typically `index.js` or `app.js`

```jsx
const express = require("express");
const {setupKinde, protectRoute, getUser, GrantType} = require("@kinde-oss/kinde-node-express");

const app = express();

const config = {
  clientId: "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>",
  issuerBaseUrl: "https://<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.kinde.com",
  siteUrl: "http://localhost:3000",
  secret: "<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>",
  redirectUrl: "http://localhost:3000",
  scope: "openid profile email",
  grantType: GrantType.AUTHORIZATION_CODE, //or CLIENT_CREDENTIALS or PKCE
  unAuthorisedUrl: "http://localhost:3000/unauthorised",
  postLogoutRedirectUrl: "http://localhost:3000"
};

setupKinde(config, app);
```

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Applications > [Your app] > View details**.
2. Replace the placeholders in the code block above with the the values from the **App Keys** section.
3. Replace `http://localhost:3000` with the url of wherever your app is running.

### Environments

As part of your development process, we highly recommend you create a development environment within your Kinde account. In this case, you'd use the Environment subdomain and app key values in the code block above.

## Set your callback and logout URLs

Kinde will redirect your user to authenticate. They'll be redirected back to your Express app after signing in or signing up.

To authenticate your app, you need to specify which URL Kinde should redirect your user.

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Applications > [Your app] > View details**.
2. Set the **Allowed callback URLs** (redirect URIs) to the URL of your app. This is where your application is served. For local development this could be `http://localhost:3000`. This is required for your users to sign in to your app successfully. This should match the `redirectUrl` you set in the config in the previous step.
3. Set the URLs they'll be redirected to after signing out, by adding **Allowed logout redirect URLs** to your JavaScript applications logout page. For local development this could be `http://localhost:3000`. This should match the `siteUrl` you set in the config in the previous step.
4. Select **Save**.

**Note**: `http://localhost:3000` is an example of a commonly used local development URL. It should be replaced with the URL where your app is running.

## Sign in / register

Kinde provides sign in / register methods that are easy to implement. Here’s an example of adding buttons to your HTML:

```html
<div id="logged_out_view">
  <a href="/login">Sign in</a>
  <a href="/register">Register</a>
</div>
```

Clicking either of these buttons redirects your user to Kinde, where they authenticate before being redirected back to your site.

## Handle redirect

Once your user is redirected back to your site from Kinde, you can set a callback to take place. The callback automatically passes in the user object and any application state you set prior to the redirect.

```jsx
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  if (req.session && req.session.access_token) {
    res.send("You are authenticated!");
  } else {
    res.send("You are not");
  }
});
```

## Protecting routes

The `protectRoute` middleware included in the SDK allows you to tell Express which routes are for authorized users only.

```jsx
app.get("/admin", protectRoute, (req, res) => {
  res.send("Welcome to the admin area");
});
```

You can pass an `unAuthorisedUrl` into the `setupKinde` configuration object which will to tell Kinde where you would like the user to be redirected in the case of `protectRoute` identifying the user is not yet authenticated.

## Access the user object

The `getUser` middleware included in the SDK allows you to add the user object to the request.

```jsx
app.get("/admin", protectRoute, getUser, (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.user);
  res.send(`Hello, ${req.user.given_name}`);
});
```

## Sign out

This is implemented in much the same way as signing in or registering. The Kinde SDK already comes with a `/logout` method.

```html
<a href="/logout">Sign out</a>
```

## Test sign up

Register your first user by signing up yourself. You'll see your newly registered user on the **Users** page of the relevant organization in Kinde.

## Verify JWT

This SDK also contains a library for verifying JWTs signed by Kinde. used as a layer of protect API endpoints. Initialize the library as follows:

```jsx
const {jwtVerify} = require("@kinde-oss/kinde-node-express");

const verifier = jwtVerify("https://<your_kinde_subdomain>.kinde.com");
```

Replace `<your_kinde_subdomain>` above with the subdomain you registered on Kinde. The step above caches your JWKS for Kinde in your Express application.

### Protect endpoints

If you add the verifier middleware to an endpoint it will validate the token. If valid the users Kinde id is added to the request, otherwise a 403 error is thrown.

```jsx
app.get("/some-route", verifier, (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.user); // {id: kp:the-users-kinde-id}
});
```
