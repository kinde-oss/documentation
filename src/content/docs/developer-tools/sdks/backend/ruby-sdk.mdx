{/* @case-police-ignore Api */}

The Kinde Ruby SDK gem allows developers to integrate Kinde API into any ruby-based applications, Rails or non-Rails.

The gem contains all the related oauth2 authorization, and 3 pre-built OAuth flows: **client credentials**, **authorization code** and **authorization code with PKCE code verifier**.

You can also view the [Ruby docs](https://github.com/kinde-oss/kinde-ruby-sdk) and [Ruby starter kit](https://github.com/kinde-starter-kits/ruby-starter-kit) in GitHub.

## Register for Kinde

If you haven’t already got a Kinde account, [register for free here](https://app.kinde.com/register) (no credit card required). Registering gives you a Kinde domain, which you need to get started, e.g. `yourapp.kinde.com`

## Install

Add this line into your Gemfile and run a bundler or install manually through a gem command.

```ruby
gem 'kinde_sdk', git: '<https://github.com/kinde-oss/kinde-ruby-sdk.git>', branch: 'main'

```

## Set callback URLs

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Applications > [Your app] > View details**.
2. Add your callback URLs in the relevant fields. For example:
   - Allowed callback URLs (also known as redirect URIs) - for example, `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/kinde_callback`
   - Allowed logout redirect URLs - for example, `http://localhost:8000`
3. Select **Save**.

## Add environments

Kinde comes with a production environment, but you can set up other environments if you want to. Note that each environment needs to be set up independently, so you need to use the Environment subdomain in the code block above for those new environments.

## Configure your app

### **Environment variables**

The following variables need to be replaced in the code snippets below.

- `KINDE_DOMAIN` - your Kinde domain - e.g. `https://your_kinde_domain.kinde.com`
- `KINDE_REDIRECT_URL` - your callback url, make sure this URL is under your allowed callback redirect URLs. - e.g. `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/kinde_callback`
- `KINDE_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL` - where you want users to be redirected to after logging out, make sure this URL is under your allowed logout redirect URLs. - e.g. `http://localhost:8000`
- `KINDE_CLIENT_ID` - you can find this on the **Application details** page - e.g. `your_kinde_client_id`
- `KINDE_CLIENT_SECRET` - you can find this on the **Application details** page - e.g. `your_kinde_client_secret`

## Integrate with your app

You can easily configure via the gem. For example, in a typical Rails-app it can be configured through the initializer file:

```ruby


KindeSdk.configure do |c|
 c.domain = domain
 c.client_id = client_id
 c.client_secret = client_secret
 c.callback_url = callback_url
 c.logout_url = logout_url
 # c.scope = 'openid offline email profile' # default value
 # c.pkce_enabled = true                    # default value
 # c.authorize_url = '/oauth2/auth'         # default value
 # c.token_url = '/oauth2/token'            # default value
 # c.debugging = false                      # default value
 c.logger = Rails.logger
end

```

The snippet above contains all the possible configuration values.
Here is a detailed explanation of them:

- `Domain` refers to your organization - for example, `your-biz.kinde.com`.
- `Client id` and `Client secret` can be found in Kinde. Go to **Settings > Applications > [yourapplication] > Details.**
- `Callback url` (or redirect URI) refers to the callback processing action. The URL must be defined in the **Allowed callback URLs** section of your application.
- `Logout url` will open when the user signs out. The URL must be defined in the **Allowed callback URLs** section of your application.
- `Scope` is an OAuth special parameter which is used to limit some rights.
- `PKCE enabled` is a flag that can turn off PKCE auth flow. By default it is activated to improve security.
- `Authorize url` and `Token url` are paths to Oauth2 methods in kinde.
- `Debugging` set to `True` for long request logs. Can be useful while developing your application.
- `Business name` is a parameter which is used in requests building. By default it is extracted from your Kinde `domain` endpoint. For example, if your domain is `your-biz.kinde.com`, then business name will be set to`your-biz`. You don't need to change it.
- `Logger` set to whichever kind of loggers you are using. By default it is set to `Rails.logger` if gem is used in rails application or `Logger.new(STDOUT)` if it is not a rails app.
- `auto_refresh_tokens` defines the default behaviour on API instance method calls. If the config is set to false, there will not be any auto refreshes during method calling, otherwise each time the client will try to refresh expired tokens if `expires_at` is present (see [token expiration and refreshing](https://github.com/kinde-oss/kinde-ruby-sdk#token-expiration-and-refreshing) section).

These variables can be handled with any system you want: .env files, settings.yml or any type of config files. For example, .env file (you can name variables yourself):

```ruby
KINDE_DOMAIN=https://<your_kinde_subdomain>.kinde.com
KINDE_CLIENT_ID=<your_kinde_client_id>
KINDE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_kinde_client_secret>
KINDE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/callback
KINDE_LOGOUT_URL=http://localhost:3000/logout_callback

```

This can be used as:

```ruby
KindeSdk.configure do |c|
 c.domain = ENV['KINDE_DOMAIN']
 c.client_id = ENV['KINDE_CLIENT_ID']
 # ....
end

```

The `KINDE_MANAGEMENT_CLIENT_ID` and the `KINDE_MANAGEMENT_CLIENT_SECRET` can be used for accessing the Kinde management API using the `client_credentials` grant, without redirection, see details in the [management API section](https://github.com/kinde-oss/kinde-ruby-sdk#management-api).

```ruby
KindeSdk.client_credentials_access(
  client_id: ENV["KINDE_MANAGEMENT_CLIENT_ID"],
  client_secret: ENV["KINDE_MANAGEMENT_CLIENT_SECRET"]
)
```

## Sign in and registration

The Kinde client provides methods for easy login and registration. For this, you need to acquire an auth URL by calling:

```ruby
KindeSdk.auth_url
{
 url: "https://<domain>/oauth2/auth?client_id=<client_id>&code_challenge=<generated code>&code_challenge_method=S256&redirect_uri=<redirect_uri>&response_type=code&scope=openid+offline+email+profile&state=<random string>",
 code_verifier: "<challenge verifier>"
}

```

By default, gem uses the PKCE verification flow. This means that the `code challenge` param will be added to your auth url, and the method returns verification string for the code. This can also be used in token requests.

You can disable PKCE by setting `pkce_enabled` to false in your configuration. In this case, `KindeSdk.auth_url` will only return a url:

```ruby
KindeSdk.auth_url

```

If you are about to use PCKE, our recommendation is to save the code verifier output somewhere near your later tokens output.

The `#auth_url` method can have another redirect url just in runtime. Use it with the argument:

```text
KindeSdk.auth_url(redirect_uri: "your-another-desired-callback")
```

You can put the link right in your web-application page or you can use it under the hood through redirection. After visiting the link you'll be redirected to Kinde's sign in/sign up form. And after authorizing in Kinde, you'll be redirected to callback url.

## Manage redirects

The next step is to extract code from the callback redirect. Your callback endpoint should contain logic to call the exchange method.

Callback is triggered in the body with the code. Use the whole `params` object or to extract code from `params["code"]`.

Next, exchange access and refresh tokens. You will receive `code` as the parameter in the callback endpoint, and `code_verifier` (if PKCE enabled) as per the previous step.

```ruby
KindeApi.fetch_tokens(code, code_verifier: code_verifier)
{"access_token"=>"eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIm...",
 "expires_in"=>86399,
 "id_token"=>"eyJhbGciOiJSUz",
 "refresh_token"=>"eyJhbGciOiJSUz",
 "scope"=>"openid offline email profile",
 "token_type"=>"bearer"}

```

Save the whole hash in your session, redis or any other storage, and use it to build your client.

```ruby
session[:kinde_auth] = KindeApi.fetch_tokens(code).slice(:access_token, :refresh_token, :expires_at)
client = KindeApi.client(session[:kinde_auth]) # => #<KindeApi::Client:0x00007faf31e5ecb8>

```

## Fetch tokens

The `#fetch_tokens` method can have another callback url (just lake the `#auth_url` method), just use it in a same way:

```text
KindeSdk.fetch_tokens(code, redirect_uri: "your-another-desired-callback")
```

### **Token expiration and refreshing**

For proper refreshing you'll need to use `access_token`, `refresh_token` and probably `expires_in` if you want to know if your access token still actual. Use these two methods to work with refreshing:

```text
KindeSdk.token_expired?(session[:kinde_auth])# => false
KindeSdk.refresh_token(session[:kinde_auth])# => {"access_token" => "qwe...", "refresh_token" => "fqw...", "expires_at"=>1685474405}

```

Or from your client instance:

```text
client.token_expired?# => false
client.refresh_token# => {"access_token" => "qwe...", ...., "expires_at"=>1685474405}

```

If you are calling `#refresh_token` on a client instance, the instance token data will be automatically updated. If you are calling `KindeSdk#refresh_token`, you'll need to store new token data in your configured storage (redis, session, etc).

## **Audience**

An `audience` is the intended recipient of an access token - for example the API for your application. The audience argument can be passed to the Kinde `#auth_url` method to request an audience be added to the provided token:

```text
KindeSdk.auth_url(audience: "https://your-app.kinde.com/api")
```

For details on how to connect, see [Register an API](/developer-tools/your-apis/register-manage-apis/)

## **Overriding scope**

By default `KindeSdk` requests the following scopes:

- profile
- email
- offline
- openid

You are able to change it - by configuring as per the integration instructions above - or by direct param passing into `auth_url` method:

```text
KindeSdk.auth_url(scope: "openid offline")
```

## **Getting claims**

We have provided a helper to grab any claim from your ID or access tokens. The helper defaults to access tokens:

```text
client = KindeSdk.client(session[:kinde_auth])
client.get_claim("aud")#=> {name: "aud", value: ['api.yourapp.com']}
client.get_claim("scp")#=> {name: "scp", value: ["openid", "offline"]}
```

By default claim data is fetched from access_token, but you can also do it with id_token as well:

```text
client.get_claim("some-claim", :id_token)# => {name: "some-claim", value: "some-data"}
```

## **User permissions**

After a user signs in and they are verified, the token return includes permissions for that user. [User permissions](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/user-permissions/) are set in Kinde, but you must also configure your application to unlock these functions.

```text
permissions" => [
    "create:todos",
    "update:todos",
    "read:todos",
    "delete:todos",
    "create:tasks",
    "update:tasks",
    "read:tasks",
    "delete:tasks",
]
```

We provide helper functions to more easily access permissions:

```text
client = KindeSdk.client(session[:kinde_auth])
client.get_permission("create:todos")# => {org_code: "org_1234", is_granted: true}
client.permission_granted?("create:todos")# => true
client.permission_granted?("create:orders")# => false
```

## **Feature flags**

Kinde provides [feature flag functionality](/releases/about/about-feature-flags/). So, the SDK provides methods to work with them. Here’s an example:

```text
{
  "asd": { "t": "b", "v": true },
  "eeeeee": { "t": "i", "v": 111 },
  "qqq": { "t": "s", "v": "aa" }
}
```

Note that `t` refers to type (`b` - boolean, `i` - integer, `s` - string) and `v` refers to value. You can fetch these flags with methods below:

```text
client.get_flag("asd")# => { code: "asd", is_default: false, type: "boolean", value: true }
client.get_flag("eeeeee")# => { code: "eeeeee", is_default: false, type: "integer", value: 111 }
client.get_flag("qqq")# => { code: "qqq", is_default: false, type: "string", value: "aa" }
```

If you try to call an call undefined flag, you will get an exception.

In addition to fetch existing flags, you can use fallbacks. For example:

```text
client.get_flag("undefined", { default_value: true })# => { code: "undefined", is_default: true, value: true }
```

Set the type explicitly (output omitted except value):

```text
client.get_flag("undefined_bool", { default_value: true }, "b")# => value = true
client.get_flag("undefined_string", { default_value: "true" }, "s")# => value = "true"
client.get_flag("undefined_int", { default_value: 111 }, "i")# => value = 111
```

In the example above if you try to set default_value of different types (for example: `get_flag("flag", {default_value: 1}, "s")`), you'll get an exception.

Also you have wrapper methods, for example:

```text
client.get_boolean_flag("eeeeee")# => leads to exception "Flag eeeeee value type is different from requested type"
client.get_boolean_flag("asd")# => true
client.get_boolean_flag("undefined", false)# => false

client.get_integer_flag("asd")# => exception "Flag asd value type is different from requested type"
client.get_integer_flag("undefined", "true")# => exception "Flag undefined value type is different from requested type"
client.get_integer_flag("eeeeee")# => 111
client.get_integer_flag("undefined", 123)# => 123

client.get_string_flag("qqq")# => "aa"
client.get_string_flag("undefined", "111")# => "111"
```

## **Client usage**

The API part is mounted in the `KindeSdk::Client` instance, so the short usage is:

```text
client.oauth.get_user
client.users.create_user(args)
client.organizations.get_organizations
```

The method name will be the same as API module from the SDK without `-Api` part. Alternatively, you can initialize each API module:

```text
api_client = KindeSdk.api_client(access_token)
instance_client = KindeApi::UsersApi.new(api_client)
instance_client.create_user(args)
```

## Logout

For logout you need to call in the controller (in the case of a rails app):

```ruby
redirect_to KindeSdk.logout_url, allow_other_host: true
```

Your app should handle the logout callback url (which was configured separately). After calling redirect to logout_url (if set), Kinde redirects it back to logout callback path, where you need to clear your session:

```ruby
  # .......
  def logout_callback
    Rails.logger.info("logout callback successfully received")
    reset_session
    redirect_to root_path
  end
  # ......
```

If you configured a logout redirect url in Kinde, you’ll receive a logout callback. Otherwise a Kinde logout message will be shown.

## Organizations

### Create an organization

To have a new organization created within your application, you will need to run something like:

```ruby
client.organizations.create_organization(create_organization_request: {name: "new_org"})
```

### Sign up and sign in to organizations

Kinde has a unique code for every organization. If you want a user to sign into a particular organization, call the `#auth_url` method with `org_code` param passing:

```ruby
KindeSdk.auth_url(org_code: "org_1234", start_page: "registration") # to enforce new user creation form
KindeSdk.auth_url(org_code: "org_1234") # to login by default
```

Following authentication, Kinde provides a json web token (jwt) to your application. Along with the standard information we also include the `org_code` and the permissions for that organization (this is important as a user can belong to multiple organizations and have different permissions for each).

Example of a returned token:

```ruby
[
  {
    "aud" => [],
    "exp" => 1658475930,
    "iat" => 1658472329,
    "iss" => "https://your_subdomain.kinde.com",
    "jti" => "123457890",
    "org_code" => "org_1234",
    "permissions" => ["read:todos", "create:todos"],
    "scp" => [
      "openid",
      "profile",
      "email",
      "offline"
    ],
    "sub" => "kp:123457890",
    "feature_flags" => {
      "asd" => { "t" => "b", "v" => true },
      "eeeeee" => { "t" => "i", "v" => 111 },
      "qqq" => { "t" => "s", "v" => "aa" }
    }
  }
]
```

The `id_token` will also contain an array of organizations that a user belongs to - this is useful if you wanted to build out an organization switcher for example:

```ruby
client.get_claim("org_codes", :id_token) # => {name: "org_codes", value: ["
```

For more information about how organizations work in Kinde, see [Kinde organizations for developers](/build/organizations/orgs-for-developers/).

## Get user info

```ruby
KindeSdk.client(session[:kinde_auth]).oauth.get_user

```

## Kinde management API

The Kinde Management API can only be accessed by back-end or machine-to-machine applications. Eventually, anything that can be done through the Kinde admin area (and more) can also be done via this API.

To get started, you will need an access token, the Ruby SDK includes a helper to get one.

```ruby
result = KindeSdk.client_credentials_access(
  client_id: ENV["KINDE_MANAGEMENT_CLIENT_ID"],
  client_secret: ENV["KINDE_MANAGEMENT_CLIENT_SECRET"]
)
$redis.set("kinde_m2m_token", result["access_token"], ex: result["expires_in"].to_i)
```

This token can then be used to call any of the endpoints in the [Kinde Management API](https://kinde.com/api/docs/#kinde-management-api).

### Organizations handling

```ruby
client = KindeSdk.client({"access_token" => $redis.get("kinde_m2m_token")})
client.organizations.get_organizations

client.organizations.create_organization(create_organization_request: {name: "new_org"})
```

### Create new user

```ruby
client.users.create_user(
  create_user_request: {
    profile: {given_name: "AAAname", family_name: "AAAsurname"},
    identities: [{type: "email", details: {email: "aaexample@asd.com"}}]
  }
)
```

Alternatively, using model instances:

```jsx
request = KindeApi::CreateUserRequest.new(
  profile: KindeApi::CreateUserRequestProfile.new(given_name: "AAAfirstname1", family_name: "AAAlastname1"),
  identities: [
    KindeApi::CreateUserRequestIdentitiesInner.new(type: "email", details: KindeApi::CreateUserRequestIdentitiesInnerDetails.new(email: "aaaaexample@example.com"))
  ]
)
client.users.create_user(create_user_request: request)
```

### Add organization users

```ruby
client.organizations.add_organization_users(code: "org_1111", users: ["kp:12311...."])

```

### Token expiration and refreshing

For proper refreshing you'll need to use `access_token`, `refresh_token` and probably `expires_in` if you want to know if your access token is still active. Use these two methods to work with refreshing:

```ruby
KindeApi.token_expired?(session[:kinde_auth]) # => false
KindeApi.refresh_token(session[:kinde_auth]) # => {"access_token" => "qwe...", "refresh_token" => "fqw...", .....}

```

`KindeApi#refresh_token` returns a new token hash, so it needs to be updated in your storage.
