The Nuxt Kinde module allows developers to integrate Kinde authentication into their existing Nuxt projects.

For new projects, you can also find our [Starter Kit on GitHub](https://github.com/kinde-starter-kits/nuxt-starter-kit).

## Supported versions

Nuxt 3+.

## Register with Kinde

If you haven’t already got a Kinde account, [register for free here](https://app.kinde.com/register) (no credit card required). Registering gives you a Kinde domain, which you need to get started, e.g. **yourapp.kinde.com**.

## Install the module

Install the `@nuxtjs/kinde` dependency using your package manager of choice.

```bash
npx nuxi@latest module add kinde
```

## Integrate with your app

Add `@nuxtjs/kinde` to the modules section of your `nuxt.config.ts`.

```jsx
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ["@nuxtjs/kinde"]
});
```

Add the following values to your `.env` file. If you don't have one create a file in the root of your project.

```bash
NUXT_KINDE_CLIENT_ID=<your_kinde_client_id>
NUXT_KINDE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_kinde_client_secret>
NUXT_KINDE_AUTH_DOMAIN=https://<your_kinde subdomain>.kinde.com
NUXT_KINDE_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/callback
NUXT_KINDE_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000
NUXT_KINDE_PASSWORD=<a random password which will be used to encrypt the session cookie>
NUXT_KINDE_POST_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000/dashboard
```

Replace [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000/) with the URL where your project is running.

## Set callback URLs

For your app to work with Kinde, you need to set callback and logout redirect URLs.

Replace the values you see in `<code brackets>` with your own values.

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Applications.**
2. Select **View details** on your app.
3. Scroll down to the **Callback URLs** section.
4. Add in the callback URLs for your project, which might look something like this:
   - Allowed callback URLs (also known as Redirect URIs)- `<http://localhost:3000>/api/callback>`
   - Allowed logout redirect URLs - `<http://localhost:3000>`
5. Select **Save**.

**Tip**: Make sure there are no hidden spaces in URLs and remove the ‘/’ backslash at the end.

## Environments

If you would like to use different Environments as part of your development process, you will need to [add them within your Kinde business](/build/environments/environments/) first. You will also need to add the Environment subdomain to the code block above.

## Login and register

Kinde supports an easy to implement login / register flow.

Use the button examples below to redirect your users to Kinde, where they authenticate before being redirected back to your site.

```jsx

<LoginLink to="/api/login" external>
	Sign in
</LoginLink>

<RegisterLink to="/api/register" external>
	Sign up
</RegisterLink>
```

## R**edirect after authentication**

After your user has authenticated they will be redirected to the URL set in your `.env` file

```bash
NUXT_KINDE_POST_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL=<where_your_project_is_running>
```

## Protecting pages

It’s likely that your project will have both pages that are publicly available and private ones which should only be available to logged in users. Add this code snippet to pages you would like to protect.

```jsx
<script setup lang="ts">
	definePageMeta({
	  middleware: ['auth-logged-in'],
	})
</script>
```

## Getting all permissions for the current user

Once a user has been verified, your project or app returns the JWT token with an array of permissions for that user. Configure your app to read permissions and unlock the respective functions.

[Set permissions](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/user-permissions/) in your Kinde account. Here’s an example set of permissions.

```jsx
const permissions = [
  "create:todos",
  "update:todos",
  "read:todos",
  "delete:todos",
  "create:tasks",
  "update:tasks",
  "read:tasks",
  "delete:tasks"
];
```

We provide helper functions to more easily access the permissions claim, example of usage:

```jsx
const client = useKindeClient();

const {data: permissions} = await useAsyncData(async () => {
  const {permissions} = (await client?.getPermissions()) ?? {};
  return permissions;
});
// { orgCode: 'org_1234', permissions: ['create:todos', 'update:todos', 'read:todos'] }

const {data: hasAccess} = await useAsyncData(async () => {
  return (await client?.getPermission("create:todos")) ?? {};
});
// { orgCode: 'org_1234', isGranted: true }
```

## Feature flags

When a user signs in, the access token your project/application receives contains a custom claim called `feature_flags` which is an object detailing the feature flags for that user.

You can [set feature flags](/releases/feature-flags/add-feature-flag/) in your Kinde account. Here’s an example.

```jsx
feature_flags: {
  theme: {
      "t": "s",
      "v": "pink"
 },
 is_dark_mode: {
      "t": "b",
      "v": true
  },
 competitions_limit: {
      "t": "i",
      "v": 5
  }
}
```

We have provided a helper to grab any feature flag. For example:

```jsx
const getFeatureFlag = async (feature: string) => {
  return await client?.getFlag(feature);
}
```

You can find specific `string`, `boolean` and `integer` helpers in the [TypeScript SDK ](/developer-tools/sdks/backend/typescript-sdk/#feature-flags)docs.

## Check if the user is authenticated

You can check if a user is logged in with the `$auth.loggedIn` context.

```jsx
<p v-if="$auth.loggedIn">
	I'm signed in!
</p>
<p v-else>
 I'm signed out :(
</p>
```

## Logout

This is implemented in much the same way as signing up or signing in.

```jsx
<NuxtLink to="/api/logout" external>
  Sign out
</NuxtLink>
```

## Test sign up

Register your first user by signing up yourself. You’ll see your newly registered user on the **Users** page in Kinde.

## Get user information

### User profile

User details can be found on the `$auth.user` object

```jsx
{{ $auth.user }}

// returns
{
	id: "kp_12345556666",
	given_name: "Sally",
	family_name: "Smith",
	email: "sally.smith@example.com",
	picture: "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/1234",
	updated_at: 1697769735
}
```

## Organizations

### Create an organization

To have a new organization created within your project, you can use the register api end point and pass `is_create_org="true"`. This will redirect the user to Kinde and create an organization with them as a member.

```jsx
<NuxtLink to="/api/register?is_create_org=true" external>
  Register and create org
</NuxtLink>
```

### Sign users up or in to an organization

When a user signs up or in to an organization, the `org_code` needs to be passed with the request. The `org_code` refers to the one created automatically in Kinde when the organization was created.

Here’s an helper function for registering or signing in below using `org_0e9f496742ae` as an example:

```jsx
<NuxtLink to="/api/login?org_code=org_code=org_0e9f496742ae" external>
	Sign in to org
</NuxtLink>

<NuxtLink to="/api/regiser?org_code=org_0e9f496742ae" external>
	Sign up to org
</NuxtLink>
```

Because a user can belong to multiple organizations, and because they may have different permissions for the different organizations, we will pass you both the `org_code` and `permissions` back in the token when authentication is initiated like this.

## Health check

To check your configuration, the SDK exposes an endpoint with your settings.

`/api/health`

**Note**: The client secret will indicate only if the secret is set or not set correctly.

To enable set the debug property within the Kinde config.

```jsx
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  kinde: {
    debug: true
  }
});
```

```jsx
{
	"apiPath": "https://<your_kinde subdomain>.kinde.com",
	"redirectURL": "http://localhost:3000/api/callback",
	"postLoginRedirectURL": "http://localhost:3000/dashboard",
	"logoutRedirectURL": "http://localhost:3000",
	"clientID": "<your_kinde_client_id>",
	"clientSecret": "Set correctly"
}
```

## Kinde Management API

You need to enable the application’s access to the Kinde Management API. You can do this in Kinde by going to **Settings > APIs > Kinde Management API** and then toggling on your Next.js application under the **Applications** tab.

To use our management API please see [@kinde/management-api-js](https://github.com/kinde-oss/management-api-js)
