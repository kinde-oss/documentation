The Kinde .NET SDK allows developers to quickly and securely integrate a new or an existing .NET application to the Kinde platform. The Kinde SDK is available from the Nuget package repository at [https://www.nuget.org/packages/Kinde.SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Kinde.SDK)

You can also view the [.NET docs](https://github.com/kinde-oss/kinde-dotnet-sdk) and [.NET starter kit](https://github.com/kinde-starter-kits/dotnet-starter-kit) in GitHub.

## Before you begin

- Kinde .NET SDK supports .NET 6.0+
- If you haven’t already got a Kinde account, [register for free here](https://app.kinde.com/register) (no credit card required). Registering gives you a Kinde domain, which you need to get started, e.g. `yourapp.kinde.com`.

## Add packages to your application

Use `Dotnet CLI` or `NuGet CLI` to add packages in your project.

Dotnet CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package Kinde.SDK
```

NuGet:

```bash
NuGet\Install-Package Kinde.SDK
```

This command is intended to be used within the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio, as it uses the NuGet module's version of Install-Package.

## Set callback URLs

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Applications > [Your app] > View details**.
2. Add your callback URLs in the relevant fields. For example:
   - Allowed callback URLs (also known as redirect URIs) - for example: `https://localhost:6789/home/callback`
   - Allowed logout redirect URLs - for example: `https://localhost:6789`
3. Select **Save**.

## Add environments

Kinde comes with a production environment, but you can set up other environments if you want to. Note that each environment needs to be set up independently, so you need to use the Environment subdomain in the code block above for those new environments.

## Configure your app

### **Environment variables**

Put these variables in your .env file:

- `KINDE_SITE_URL` - where your app is running
- `KINDE_ISSUER_URL` - your Kinde domain
- `KINDE_POST_CALLBACK_URL` - After the user authenticates we will callback to this address. Make sure this URL is under your Allowed callback URLs (also known as redirect URIs).
- `KINDE_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL` - where you want users to be redirected to after logging out. Make sure this URL is under your allowed logout redirect URLs.
- `KINDE_CLIENT_ID` - you can find this on the Application details page
- `KINDE_CLIENT_SECRET` - you can find this on the Application details page

SDK also supports configuration from the `appsetings.json` file. If you want, you can write your own implementation of `IAuthorizationConfigurationProvider` and `IIdentityProviderConfigurationProvider`.

```json
{
...
"KindeSettings": {
    "Domain": <KINDE_ISSUER_URL>,
    "CallbackUrl": <KINDE_POST_CALLBACK_URL>
},
"ApplicationConfiguration": {
    "Domain": <KINDE_ISSUER_URL>,
    "ReplyUrl": <KINDE_POST_CALLBACK_URL>,
    "LogoutUrl": <KINDE_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL>
},
"DefaultAuthorizationConfiguration": {
    "ConfigurationType": "Kinde.Api.Models.Configuration.<THE_LOGIN_METHOD_YOU_PREFER>",
    "Configuration": {
        "State": null,
        "ClientId": <KINDE_CLIENT_ID>,
        "Scope": "openid offline profile",
        "GrantType": "code id_token token",
        "ClientSecret": <KINDE_CLIENT_SECRET>
    }
},
...
}
```

Replace everything in \< angle brackets > with your own values. Here’s an example:

```json
{
...
"KindeSettings": {
    "Domain": "https://your_kinde_domain.kinde.com",
    "CallbackUrl": "https://localhost:7165/home/callback"
},
"ApplicationConfiguration": {
    "Domain": "https://your_kinde_domain.kinde.com",
    "ReplyUrl": "https://localhost:7165/home/callback",
    "LogoutUrl":  "https://localhost:7165/home"
},
"DefaultAuthorizationConfiguration": {
    "ConfigurationType": "Kinde.Api.Models.Configuration.PKCES256Configuration",
    "Configuration": {
        "State": null,
        "ClientId": your_kinde_client_id,
        "Scope": "openid offline profile",
        "GrantType": "code id_token token",
        "ClientSecret": your_kinde_client_secret
    }
},
...
}
```

In your startup file (usually called `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs`), register configuration providers using .NET DI:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddTransient<IAuthorizationConfigurationProvider, DefaultAuthorizationConfigurationProvider>();
builder.Services.AddTransient<IApplicationConfigurationProvider, DefaultApplicationConfigurationProvider>();
builder.Services.AddSession();
...
var app = builder.Build();
app.UseSession();
```

Note: The above configuration providers are referenced in the `Kinde.Api.Models.Configuration` and the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Session` assembly. Those assemblies must be added to your project.

PKC256 Configuration example:

This is the most complicated configuration. The configuration for the Authentication code is the same. For Client credentials, `State` is not applicable, but you don’t need to remove it.

All available types are:

1. `Kinde.Api.Models.Configuration.PKCES256Configuration`
2. `Kinde.Api.Models.Configuration.AuthorizationCodeConfiguration`
3. `Kinde.Api.Models.Configuration.ClientCredentialsConfiguration`

Besides configuration, all code approaches are quite similar. The only difference is if the authorization flow requires user redirection. In which case, for Client Credentials configuration `Authorize()` call is enough for authorization. For others (PKCE and Authorization code) you should handle redirection to Kinde (as IdP) and handle callback to end authorization.

## Integrate with your app

You'll need to declare your configurations provider in your controller.

```csharp
...
using Kinde.Api;
using Kinde.Api.Client;
using Kinde.Api.Models.Configuration;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
...

public class YourController : Controller
{
...
		private readonly IAuthorizationConfigurationProvider _authConfigurationProvider;
		private readonly IApplicationConfigurationProvider _appConfigurationProvider;
...

		public YourController (..., IAuthorizationConfigurationProvider authConfigurationProvider, IApplicationConfigurationProvider appConfigurationProvider)
		{
		...
				_authConfigurationProvider = authConfigurationProvider;
				_appConfigurationProvider = appConfigurationProvider;
		...
		}
}
```

## Log in and registration

The Kinde client provides methods for easy sign in and register flows.

For example, if add buttons in your HTML as follows:

```html
<div class="navigation">
  @Html.ActionLink("Sign in","Login", "YourController") @Html.ActionLink("Sign up","Signup", "
  YourController")
</div>
```

Then define new actions in `YourController`:

```csharp
public async Task<IActionResult> Login()
{
	// We need some artificial id to correlate user session to client instance

	// NOTE: Session.Id will be always random, we need to add something to session to make it persistent.
	var correlationId = HttpContext.Session?.GetString("KindeCorrelationId");

	if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(correlationId))
	{
		correlationId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
		HttpContext.Session.SetString("KindeCorrelationId", correlationId);
	}

	// Get client's instance...
	var client = KindeClientFactory.Instance.GetOrCreate(correlationId, _appConfigurationProvider.Get());

	// ...and authorize it
	await client.Authorize(_authConfigurationProvider.Get());

	// if auth flow is not ClientCredentials flow, we need to redirect user to another page
	if (client.AuthorizationState == Kinde.Api.Enums.AuthorizationStates.UserActionsNeeded)
	{
		// redirect user to login page
		return Redirect(await client.GetRedirectionUrl(correlationId));
	}
		return RedirectToAction("Index");
}

public async Task<IActionResult> SignUp()
{
	var correlationId = HttpContext.Session?.GetString("KindeCorrelationId");

	if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(correlationId))
	{
		correlationId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
		HttpContext.Session.SetString("KindeCorrelationId", correlationId);
	}

	var client = KindeClientFactory.Instance.GetOrCreate(correlationId, _appConfigurationProvider.Get());

	await client.Register(_authConfigurationProvider.Get());

	if (client.AuthorizationState == Kinde.Api.Enums.AuthorizationStates.UserActionsNeeded)
	{
		return Redirect(await client.GetRedirectionUrl(correlationId));
	}

	return RedirectToAction("Index");
}
```

When defining the above methods in your controller class, ensure that Kinde assembly is included by adding `using Kinde;`

## Manage redirects

When the user is redirected back to your site from Kinde, this code executes:

```csharp
public IActionResult Callback(string code, string state)
{
	KindeClient.OnCodeReceived(code, state);
	var correlationId = HttpContext.Session?.GetString("KindeCorrelationId");
	var client = KindeClientFactory.Instance.Get(correlationId); // already authorized instance

	if(client.AuthorizationState == Kinde.Api.Enums.AuthorizationStates.Authorized) {
		var organizationId = client.GetOrganization(); // use the client to retrieve details about the user
	}
	return RedirectToAction("Index");
}
```

## **Log out**

Logging out is a two step process: local cache cleanup and token revocation on the Kinde side.

When the `client.Logout()` method is called, it redirects the user to a redirect URL for token revocation.

Example:

```csharp
public async Task<IActionResult> Logout()
{
	var correlationId = HttpContext.Session?.GetString("KindeCorrelationId");
	var client = KindeClientFactory.Instance.GetOrCreate(correlationId, _appConfigurationProvider.Get());
	var url = await client.Logout();
	return Redirect(url);
}
```

## Get user information

You need to have already authenticated before you call the API, otherwise errors can happen. To access the user information, use the `GetUserDetails` method:

```csharp
public async Task<IActionResult> Index()
{
	if (HttpContext.Session.GetString("KindeCorrelationId") != null)
	{
		var client = KindeClientFactory.Instance.Get(HttpContext.Session.GetString("KindeCorrelationId"));

		if(client.AuthorizationState == Kinde.Api.Enums.AuthorizationStates.Authorized)
		{
			ViewBag.Authorized = true;
			var model = await client.GetUserDetails();
			return View("Index", model);
		}
	}
	return View("Index");
}
```

### View users in Kinde

Go to the **Users** page in Kinde to see who has registered.

## User permissions

After a user signs in and they are verified, the token return includes permissions for that user. [User permissions are set in Kinde](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/user-permissions/), but you must also configure your application to unlock these functions.

Example permissions:

```csharp
String[] permissions = {
	"create:todos",
	"update:todos",
	"read:todos",
	"delete:todos",
	"create:tasks",
	"update:tasks",
	"read:tasks",
	"delete:tasks",
}
```

We provide helper functions to more easily access permissions:

```csharp
client.GetPermission("create:todos");
// { OrganizationId: "org_1234", Granted: True, Id: "create:todos"}

client.GetPermissions();
// { OrganizationId: "org_1234", Permissions: {"create:todos", "update:todos", "read:todos"}}
```

A practical example in code might look something like:

```csharp
if (client.GetPermission("create:todos").Granted) {
    // Need to implement
}
```

## Audience

An audience is the intended recipient of an access token - for example the API for your application. The audience argument can be passed to the Kinde client to request an audience be added to the provided token.

The audience of a token is the intended recipient of the token.

```json
{
	...
	Audience: "api.yourapp.com"
	...
}
```

For details on how to connect, see [Register an API](/developer-tools/your-apis/register-manage-apis/)

## Overriding scope

By default the `KindeSDK` requests the following scopes:

- `profile`
- `email`
- `offline`
- `openid`

You can override this by passing scope into the KindeSDK.

```json
{
	...
	Scope: "openid offline profile email"
	...
}
```

## Getting claims

We have provided a helper to grab any claim from your id or access tokens:

```csharp
client.GetClaim("given_name");
// "David"
```

## Organizations

### Create an organization

To have a new organization created within your application, you will need to run declare `IsCreateOrganization` in your configuration:

```json
{
	...
	IsCreateOrganization: "true"
	...
}
```

### Sign and sign in to organizations

Kinde has a unique code for every organization. You’ll have to pass the `OrganizationId` when you want to register a new user or sign into a particular organization.

```csharp
{
	...
	OrganizationId: "org_1234"
	...
}
```

Following authentication, Kinde provides a json web token (jwt) to your application. Along with the standard information we also include the `org_code` and the `permissions` for that organization (this is important as a user can belong to multiple organizations and have different permissions for each).

Example of a returned token:

```json
{
  "aud": [],
  "exp": 1658475930,
  "iat": 1658472329,
  "iss": "https://your_subdomain.kinde.com",
  "jti": "123457890",
  "org_code": "org_1234",
  "permissions": ["read:todos", "create:todos"],
  "scp": ["openid", "profile", "email", "offline"],
  "sub": "kp:123457890"
}
```

The `id_token` will also contain an array of organizations that a user belongs to - this is useful if you wanted to build out an organization switcher for example.

```json
{
	...
	"org_codes": ["org_1234", "org_4567"]
	...
}
```

There are two helper functions you can use to extract information:

```csharp
client.GetOrganization();
// "org_1234"

client.GetOrganizations();
// ["org_1234", "org_abcd"]
```

For more information about how organizations work in Kinde, see [Kinde organizations for developers](/build/organizations/orgs-for-developers/).
