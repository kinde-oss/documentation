Kinde provides Software Development Kits (SDKs) help you connect your app more easily to Kinde.

Generally, you only need one SDK per application or service. But you might use multiple SDKs if your product is comprised of applications or services written in multiple languages.

You can also use different SDKs to support front end and back end behavior, if this suits your setup.

<Aside type="warning" title="Check version compatibility">

Make sure that your tech stackâ€™s versions are compatible with the SDK you want to use.
