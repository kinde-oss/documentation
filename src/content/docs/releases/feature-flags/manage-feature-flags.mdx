Feature flags let you control user access to specific features in your app or site. Typically, feature flags are used to restrict feature access while a feature is being built.

You can incrementally roll the feature out by giving beta access to specific users, organizations, or environments, and then remove the flag when the feature is ready for global release.

Once a flag is created, you can only edit the name, description and default value.

If you’re not familiar with feature flags, you might want to read up about feature flags first.

## Find a feature flag

You can search feature flags by name or key.

1. Go to **Releases > Feature flags**.

2. Click a column heading to sort the list.
3. Type a flag name in the search bar above the list to find a specific flag.
4. Press **Enter** to show results.
5. Clear the list by deleting the search term and pressing **Enter**.

## Edit a feature flag

You can only change the name, description, and default value of a feature flag. This changes the default value for all users that inherit the flag value.

<Aside type="danger" title="You cannot edit the key, type, or override definitions of a feature flag">

Editing these fields in a feature flag that is in use will cause breaking changes in your code, which is why we don’t allow it. We suggest you create a new flag in cases where you make an error when you create a flag, or if you want to re-purpose a flag.

</Aside>

1. Go to **Releases > Feature flags**.
2. Select the three dots menu on the flag entry, and select **Edit feature flag**.
3. Edit the **Name** or **Description**.
4. Edit the **Default v\*\***alue\*\*.
5. Select **Save**. The changes will apply to all environments, organizations, and users that inherit the flag value.

If you just want to edit the flag value in a specific environment or for a particular organization or user, see [Override feature flag values](/releases/feature-flags/edit-feature-flag/).

## Delete a feature flag

You can delete a feature flag in Kinde. Deleting also removes any flag value overrides in environments, organizations, and for users. This action is not reversible.

1. Go to **Releases > Feature flags**.
2. Select the three dots menu on the flag entry, and select **Delete feature flag**.
3. In the confirmation window that appears, select **Delete feature flag**.
