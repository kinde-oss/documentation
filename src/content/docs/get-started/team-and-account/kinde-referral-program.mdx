Kinde's referral program rewards existing businesses for referring new business to Kinde. 

Referring a friend could earn you 20% of what they spend with us in a year, if they join up. They also get a $50 credit. 

## How it works

- Grab your personal referral code (see below)
- Share it with a friend or colleague
- They sign up using the link and that’s it!

## Get your Kinde referral link

1. On the Kinde home page, select the avatar menu at the bottom left and choose **Account**.
2. Go to your profile and scroll to the **Kinde referral code** section.
3. Generate your unique code (you only need to do this once).
4. Copy the code and re-use it to refer as many friends as you want.

## How to use the code

- Share directly with friends and colleagues electronically
- Post on your socials
- Share at events and in tech forums

People who use your code must sign up via the referral link. We can't honor verbal referrals or referrals who sign up via our normal sign-up page.

## How and when do you get paid?

At the end of each calendar month, you’ll be notified if any of your referrals signed up to a paid plan.

We will reach out to you on the email address associated with your Kinde account, requesting your bank details, and GST registration status (if applicable). We will generate a recipient generated tax invoice, and pay the relevant commission within 30 days of receiving your bank details.

We will disclose the total amount of commission available relating to all of your referrals but due to privacy considerations, we cannot disclose the identity of your referrals or the revenue that we receive from them.
