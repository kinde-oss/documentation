Application keys - or app keys - are credentials that you need to connect your project to Kinde. There are unique app keys for each application you have. This includes each machine to machine, front-end, back-end, or single-page application, etc.

For more information about Kinde apps, see [Applications in Kinde](/build/applications/about-applications/).

## About app keys

In the App keys section of your application in Kinde, you’ll find these details:

- **Custom domain** - if you have opted to use one
- **Domain** - this is the domain issued by Kinde
- **Client ID** - unique for this app
- **Client secret** - unique for this app (only back-end and M2M apps have client secrets)

  <Aside title="You can’t refresh client secrets in Kinde">

  Kinde does not give you the ability to generate new client secrets for an application. To keep tokens safe, follow [these token security principles](/build/tokens/refresh-tokens/#token-security-recommendations).

  </Aside>

## View and copy app keys

1. Go to **Settings > Environment > Applications**.
2. Find the application you want to connect.
3. On the application tile, select **View details**.
4. Scroll to the **App keys** section.
5. Select **Copy** to copy the keys.
6. Make sure you securely store and manage your client secret as it provides access to your Kinde account for your product.

   <Aside>

   Note that front-end (client-side) applications do not have a client secret because they run in insecure environments, typically a browser.

   </Aside>

7. Add the app key details to the .env file in your code base or starter kit. Follow the instructions in the relevant [SDK](/developer-tools/about/our-sdks/) or the README file in the starter kit.
8. Do this for each application you want to connect.
