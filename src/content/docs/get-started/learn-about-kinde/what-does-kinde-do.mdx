Kinde builds beautifully simple dev-acceleration infrastructure for SaaS teams. We provide an easy-to-use platform and code support for building:

- [Authentication and access](/authenticate/about-auth/about-authentication/)
- [Environment management](/build/environments/environments/)
- [Feature flags](/releases/about/about-feature-flags/)
- [User management](/manage-users/about/)
- [B2B/B2B2C infrastructure](/build/organizations/add-and-manage-organizations/)
- [Webhooks](/integrate/webhooks/about-webhooks/) and [connections](/integrate/connected-apps/add-connected-apps/)
- Custom [data](/properties/work-with-properties/manage-properties/), [tokens](/properties/work-with-properties/properties-in-tokens/), [pages](/design/pages/design-your-welcome-pages/), and [domains](/build/domains/pointing-your-domain/)
- Customer billing (coming soon)

Supported by [SDKs](/developer-tools/about/our-sdks/) in more than 20 different language frameworks, your engineers can focus on building your core product, without also having to build the essential functions that allow your business scale and grow.

**Kinde exists to do everything possible to propel founders and their teams forward.** Check out some of our features in action on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@heykinde/videos).
