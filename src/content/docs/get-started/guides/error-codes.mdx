Depending on the complexity of your authentication setup, you or your users may occasionally encounter errors.

Here are some common error codes and troubleshooting steps.

## Sorry we don't see  way to authenticate you

This error message typically appears when there's an issue with your authentication configuration or token handling. A few common causes include:
- Expired or invalid tokens
- Misconfigured authentication settings
- Session management issues
- Incorrect callback URLs

## State not found

The `State not found` error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between your environment variables and the domain you're using during authentication. There may be a trailing space or incorrect syntax.

## Verification code not received (email)

Verification codes are sent almost immediately when triggered. If a code is not received, it might be because:

- Junk/spam folders​ - Email providers and devices may treat OTPs from unknown providers like Kinde as spam. Check your own spam folder, or ask your IT team if emails from Kinde are quarantined by firewalls or other IT defence systems.
- Gmail delays​ - Google Workspace addresses can experience ~4 minute delays due to pre-delivery scanning
- Microsoft Defender filters​ - Aggressive anti-spam filters sometimes quarantine verification emails for Outlook/Hotmail users

If none of the above help troubleshoot the issue, contact Kinde support.

## Verification code not received (mobile device)

Verification codes are sent almost immediately when triggered. If a code is not received, it might be because:

- Network connectivity problems or poor signal strength
- Carrier-level spam filtering blocking OTP messages
- SMS delivery delays during peak usage times
- Full storage preventing new messages from being received
- Phone numbers in certain countries do sometimes experience issues. Contact us if you think this might be the case. 

We recommend using [Twilio](/authenticate/authentication-methods/phone-authentication/), a third-party SMS provider instead of Kinde's default service. This makes troubleshooting issues and accessing logs much easier.
