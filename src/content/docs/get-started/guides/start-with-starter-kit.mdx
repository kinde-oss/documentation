Once you’ve got a [Kinde business and domain](https://app.kinde.com/register), you’re ready to get started.

You’ve got a couple of options:

- **Fast and easy** - Access the guided **Quick start** via the application tile on the Kinde home page, and follow the in-app instructions for using a starter kit.
- **DIY** - Follow the instructions below.

## 1: Get a starter kit

If you’re starting a brand new project or you just want to have a play around, using one of our starter kits gives you a ready-to-use project with Kinde already integrated with your tech of choice.

[Grab a starter kit from GitHub](https://github.com/kinde-starter-kits)

Open the README file in the starter kit for instructions on how to use it to connect to Kinde. Or follow the steps below.

## 2: Add an application in Kinde

Kinde works by linking the application you set up in Kinde, with the app you’re creating yourself - or in this case, it will probably be an app that comes with the starter kit you chose.

If you know what type of application you’re building, [add it to Kinde](/build/applications/add-and-manage-applications/). Kinde also comes with a couple of pre-built applications and you can use those ones if they suit. Go to **Settings > Applications**.

## 3: Get app keys

View details of the application in Kinde and scroll down to [copy the App keys](/get-started/connect/getting-app-keys/). You’ll need to add these to the .env file that came with the starter kit.

## 4: Add app keys to the .env file

Your starter kit came with a file called `.env-sample` (or something close to that). You will want to rename it `.env`.

The .env file contains configuration information for linking with Kinde. Follow the README instructions in your starter kit to add your app keys to the .env file.

Here’s an example from the Next.js app router starter kit. You replace `<your_kinde_client_id>`, `<your_kinde_client_secret>`, and `<your_kinde_subdomain>` with details from Kinde.

```bash
KINDE_CLIENT_ID=<your_kinde_client_id>
KINDE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_kinde_client_secret>
KINDE_ISSUER_URL=https://<your_kinde_subdomain>.kinde.com

KINDE_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
KINDE_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000
KINDE_POST_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000/dashboard
```

## 5: Add callback URLs to your Kinde app

Callback and redirect URLs define where a user goes when they sign in to you app. You need to set these in order to enable users to sign up.

Go to **Settings > Applications** and select **View details** on your application in Kinde. Enter the URL details as per your starter pack README file.

For now, it will be a localhost URL. But you can add other URLs later, when your production environment is live or you set up a custom domain.

  decoding="async"
/>

## 6: Test user registration

After you complete the previous steps, you should be able to register your first user.

1. Open a terminal window where your project is running.
2. View the README file in your starter kit to get the command to start your local server and view your project in a browser. For example, the command for Next.js is `npm run dev`.
3. Once your project is running in the browser, select **Sign up** to register your first user.
4. When you’re done, view the user in the main **Users** page in Kinde.

Now you’re ready to take on the rest of the Kinde set up tasks.

## 7: Set up Kinde to work how you want it

Start configuring Kinde to work the way you want by exploring [common set up tasks](/get-started/guides/set-up-tasks/) and customizations. That’s when you’ll really start to build your business on Kinde.
