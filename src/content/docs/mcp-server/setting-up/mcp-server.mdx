Follow the steps below to connect your Kinde account to your preferred AI client and begin interacting with natural language.

## Setup

1. **Set up an environment-level API key** - Create an API key in your Kinde environment that defines the scope of access the AI client will have. This allows you to control exactly what the AI can do in your Kinde account.

   To do this, go to **Settings** > **APIs** > **Kinde Management API** > **API keys** and click **Add API key**.
   Ensure to toggle on the option ***Can be used by the Kinde MCP server*** and select the scopes you wish the AI client to have access to.

2. **Add the configuration to your AI client** - Configure your AI client (such as Claude or Cursor) with the API key and connection details provided to begin interacting with Kinde.
If you are using Cursor there is a quick-link that will do this for you.

3. **Start asking questions** - Once configured, you can use natural language to query and manage your Kinde resources through your AI client.
