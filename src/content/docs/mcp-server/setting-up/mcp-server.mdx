ai_summary: Step-by-step guide to setting up the Kinde MCP server
---

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that allows AI assistants to interact with external tools and services. Kinde's MCP Server enables AI assistants like **Cursor**, **Claude Desktop**, and **VS Code** to directly interact with your Kinde environment—letting you manage users, roles, permissions, and more using natural language. So instead of switching between your IDE and the Kinde dashboard, ask your AI assistant to perform Kinde operations for you.

### What you need

- A [Kinde](https://kinde.com) account with admin access to your business (Sign up for free)
- An AI assistant that supports MCP protocol (e.g., Cursor)

## Step 1: Create an Environment API Key

1. Sign in to your **Kinde dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **APIs** > **Kinde Management API** > select **View details**
3. Go to the **API Keys** tab
4. Select **Add API Key**, a pop up appears
5. Give your key a name (e.g., "Cursor MCP Access")
6. Check the option to **Can be used by the Kinde MCP server**

    ![add api key](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/14258cdf-eaa0-4297-f5cb-daf98039ab00/public)

7. Select the scopes you want to grant:
    - `read:users` — View user information
    - `read:organizations` — View organizations
    - `create:roles` — Create new roles
    - `create:permissions` — Create permissions
    - See all the available [scopes you can use in the Kinde MCP Server](/mcp-server/about-mcp-server/about-mcp-server/)

    <Aside type="warning" title="Security note">
      Only grant the minimum scopes necessary for your use case. You can always create additional API keys with different scope configurations.
    </Aside>

8. Select **Create**
9. Copy and save the generated API key, you will need it for the next step.

    ![copy api key](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/7f061eba-a7fa-4460-f959-9a5b56886d00/public)


## Cursor

1. Open **Cursor**
2. Go to **Cursor** > **Settings** > **Cursor Settings**
3. Navigate to **Tools & MCP**
4. Select **Add custom MCP** or if you already have other MCP servers, select **New MCP server**, the `mcp.json` file opens.
  
    ![add MCP server in cursor](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/06bb2677-6d5a-4f44-989b-5e2e81e87800/public)

5. Add the following configuration, and save the file.

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "kinde": {
          "url": "https://YOUR_BUSINESS.kinde.com/mcp",
          "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
          }
        }
      }
    }

    ```
    
    - **Replace**: `YOUR_BUSINESS` with your Kinde subdomain (e.g., `acme` for `acme.kinde.com`)
    - **Replace**: `YOUR_API_KEY` with the Environment API Key from Step 1

6. Save and restart Cursor.
7. Once enabled, you should now see the Kinde MCP server in the list of available tools.

    ![cursor MCP server enabled](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/40ea4f02-1f23-4fb0-8ef3-a4440a146900/public)  

## Claude Desktop

1. Open **Claude Desktop**
2. Go to **Settings** > **Developer** > select **Edit Config**, the `claude_desktop_config.json` file opens in your file browser.

    ![claude developer edit config](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/0662b46b-1e59-4251-9fc6-043e8efa7300/public)

3. Open the file in your preferred text editor.
4. Enter the following configuration, and save the file.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kinde": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://YOUR_BUSINESS.kinde.com/mcp",
        "--header",
        "Authorization: Bearer ${auth_token}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "auth_token": "YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}

```

5. Restart **Claude Desktop**.
6. You should now see the Kinde MCP server in the list of available tools.

    ![claude local MCP servers](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/690147de-ffae-4fe0-124b-610cf0f0e700/public)

## VS Code

1. Open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS)
2. Type `MCP: Open User Configuration` and select it
3. Add the following configuration and save the file:

    ```json
    {
      "servers": {
        "kinde": {
          "type": "http",
          "url": "https://YOUR_BUSINESS.kinde.com/mcp",
          "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

3. Restart VS Code
4. Go to the **Extensions** section and open the MCP panel. You should see the Kinde MCP server listed there.

    ![vs code MCP server enabled](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/aefee25c-d8c3-45b3-2fa6-0407338c8400/public)

## Testing the MCP Server

Once you have setup the MCP server, you can ask your AI assistant "What tools do you have available from Kinde?" to see the available operations.

Output from Claude Desktop:

```text
I have access to these Kinde API tools:

Users:

GetUsers - List/filter users by email, phone, username, user_id, or organization status
GetUserData - Get specific user details by ID

Organizations:

GetOrganizations - List organizations with sorting options
GetOrganization - Get specific organization details by code

Roles & Permissions:

CreateRole - Create new roles with keys, names, descriptions, and default settings
CreatePermission - Create new permissions with keys, names, and descriptions

All tools support expanding related data (organizations, identities, billing) where applicable.

What would you like to do with Kinde?
```


Below are some more example prompts you can try out with the MCP Server.

### User Management

- "List all users who signed up in the last 7 days"
- "Find the user with email [john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com) and show me their profile"
- "How many users do I have in total?"

### Role & Permission Management

- "Create a new role called 'content-moderator' that can read and update posts"
- "Show me all the permissions assigned to the 'admin' role"
- "What roles does the user with ID usr_abc123 have?"

### Organization Management

- "List all organizations and how many users each has"
- "Show me the feature flags enabled for the 'enterprise' organization"
- "What permissions does [john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com) have in 'acme-corp'?"

### Properties & Configuration

- "Create a custom user property called 'department' that accepts text values"
- "Show me all the environment variables configured"

## Security Best Practices

| Practice | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 🎯 Least privilege | Only grant the scopes your AI assistant actually needs |
| 🔐 Separate keys | Create different API keys for different use cases |
| 🔄 Rotate regularly | Periodically rotate your Environment API Keys |
| 👁️ Monitor usage | Check Kinde audit logs for MCP Server operations |
| 🚫 Never share | Don't commit API keys to version control |

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No tools available" or empty tool list

- ✓ Verify your API key has the correct scopes
- ✓ Ensure **Enable for MCP Server** is checked
- ✓ Check that your API key is active

### "Authentication required" or "Invalid token"

- ✓ Check your API key is copied correctly (no extra spaces)
- ✓ Verify the format: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`
- ✓ Confirm your Kinde subdomain is correct

### Connection timeout

- ✓ Check your internet connection
- ✓ Verify URL: `https://YOUR_BUSINESS.kinde.com/mcp`
- ✓ Restart your AI assistant

### Missing expected operations

- ✓ Tools depend on your API key's scopes
- ✓ Check scopes in the Kinde dashboard
- ✓ Create a new key with additional scopes if needed
