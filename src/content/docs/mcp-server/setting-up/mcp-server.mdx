ai_summary: Step-by-step guide to setting up the Kinde MCP server
---

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that allows AI assistants to interact with external tools and services. Kinde's MCP Server enables AI assistants like **Cursor**, **Claude Desktop**, and **VS Code** to directly interact with your Kinde environment—letting you manage users, roles, permissions, and more using natural language. So instead of switching between your IDE and the Kinde dashboard, ask your AI assistant to perform Kinde operations for you.

---

## What can you do with the Kinde MCP Server?

With the MCP Server connected, you can ask your AI assistant to:

| Use Case | Example Prompt |
| --- | --- |
| 👥 Query users | "Show me all users in my Kinde environment" |
| 🎭 Manage roles | "Create a new role called 'editor' with read and write permissions" |
| 🏢 View organizations | "List all organizations and their user counts" |
| 🔐 Create permissions | "Add a new permission called 'delete:posts'" |
| 🚩 Manage feature flags | "What feature flags are enabled for this organization?" |
| 📋 Handle subscribers | "Get the subscriber list for my application" |
| 🏷️ Create properties | "Create a custom user property for department" |

---

### What you need

- A [Kinde](https://kinde.com) account with admin access to your business (Sign up for free)
- An AI assistant that supports MCP protocol (e.g., Cursor)

## Step 1: Create an Environment API Key

1. Sign in to your **Kinde dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **APIs** > **Kinde Management API** > select **View details**
3. Go to the **API Keys** tab
4. Select **Add API Key**, a pop up appears
5. Give your key a name (e.g., "Cursor MCP Access")
6. Check the option to **Can be used by the Kinde MCP server**

    ![add api key](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/14258cdf-eaa0-4297-f5cb-daf98039ab00/public)

7. Select the scopes you want to grant:
    - `read:users` — View user information
    - `read:organizations` — View organizations
    - `create:roles` — Create new roles
    - `create:permissions` — Create permissions
    - Add other scopes based on your needs

    <Aside type="warning" title="Security note">
      Only grant the minimum scopes necessary for your use case. You can always create additional API keys with different scope configurations.
    </Aside>

8. Select **Create**
9. Copy and save the generated API key, you will need it for the next step.

    ![copy api key](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/7f061eba-a7fa-4460-f959-9a5b56886d00/public)

## Step 2: Configure Your AI Assistant

### Cursor

1. Open **Cursor**
2. Go to **Cursor** > **Settings** > **Cursor Settings**
3. Navigate to **Tools & MCP**
4. Select **Add custom MCP** or if you already have other MCP servers, select **New MCP server**, the `mcp.json` file opens.
  
    ![add MCP server in cursor](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/06bb2677-6d5a-4f44-989b-5e2e81e87800/public)

5. Add the following configuration, and save the file.

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "kinde": {
          "url": "https://YOUR_BUSINESS.kinde.com/mcp",
          "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
          }
        }
      }
    }

    ```
    
    - **Replace**: `YOUR_BUSINESS` with your Kinde subdomain (e.g., `acme` for `acme.kinde.com`)
    - **Replace**: `YOUR_API_KEY` with the Environment API Key from Step 1

6. Save and restart Cursor.
7. You should now see the Kinde MCP server in the list of available tools.

    ![cursor MCP server enabled](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/40ea4f02-1f23-4fb0-8ef3-a4440a146900/public)  

### Claude Desktop

1. Open **Claude Desktop**
2. Go to **Settings** > **Developer** > select **Edit Config**, the `claude_desktop_config.json` file opens in your file browser.

    ![claude developer edit config](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/0662b46b-1e59-4251-9fc6-043e8efa7300/public)

3. Open the file in your preferred text editor.
4. Enter the following configuration, and save the file.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kinde": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://YOUR_BUSINESS.kinde.com/mcp",
        "--header",
        "Authorization: Bearer ${auth_token}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "auth_token": "YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}

```

5. Restart **Claude Desktop**.
6. You should now see the Kinde MCP server in the list of available tools.

    ![claude local MCP servers](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/690147de-ffae-4fe0-124b-610cf0f0e700/public)

### VS Code (with MCP extension)

1. Open your **VS Code settings**
2. Find the MCP server configuration section
3. Add the Kinde server with the same URL and authorization header format as above

## Step 3: Verify the Connection

Once configured, verify the connection by asking your AI assistant:

> "What tools do you have available from Kinde?"
> 

Your assistant should list the available Kinde operations based on the scopes you granted.

## Security Best Practices

| Practice | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 🎯 Least privilege | Only grant the scopes your AI assistant actually needs |
| 🔐 Separate keys | Create different API keys for different use cases |
| 🔄 Rotate regularly | Periodically rotate your Environment API Keys |
| 👁️ Monitor usage | Check Kinde audit logs for MCP Server operations |
| 🚫 Never share | Don't commit API keys to version control |

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No tools available" or empty tool list

- ✓ Verify your API key has the correct scopes
- ✓ Ensure **Enable for MCP Server** is checked
- ✓ Check that your API key is active

### "Authentication required" or "Invalid token"

- ✓ Check your API key is copied correctly (no extra spaces)
- ✓ Verify the format: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`
- ✓ Confirm your Kinde subdomain is correct

### Connection timeout

- ✓ Check your internet connection
- ✓ Verify URL: `https://YOUR_BUSINESS.kinde.com/mcp`
- ✓ Restart your AI assistant

### Missing expected operations

- ✓ Tools depend on your API key's scopes
- ✓ Check scopes in the Kinde dashboard
- ✓ Create a new key with additional scopes if needed
