The Kinde MCP (Model Context Protocol) server acts as a bridge between AI assistants and your Kinde account, enabling you to ask questions and perform actions using natural language, such as:

    - **"What organizations do I have in Kinde?"** 
    - **"Does the user john@doe.com exist?"** 
    - **"What roles does this user have?"** 
    - **"List all users in the default organization"** 

    ![what organizations I have](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/5c3d4bd2-a7ef-44b8-4265-fbb5603ab300/public)

It allows you to interact with your Kinde account using a subset of the features available via the [Kinde Management API](/developer-tools/kinde-api/).

## How it works

- An environment-level API key is set up in Kinde, which forms part of the MCP server configuration that is copied into your AI client.
- Once the configuration is added, the AI client will validate the provided API key, then detect the available tools that the MCP server provides. These tools will be restricted to the scopes you defined for the API key.
- When you make requests to the AI client such as "What organizations do I have in Kinde?", it will look for an appropriate MCP server tool to use for your request.
- The request is sent to the MCP server, which will use your API key to perform actions against the Kinde Management API.

## Why use the Kinde MCP Server?

The MCP server provides a new way to interact with your Kinde account. In addition to the Kinde UI and the Management API, the MCP server offers these additional benefits:

- **Move faster** - Execute Kinde operations without leaving your IDE
- **Less context switching** - Manage users and permissions with natural language
- **Automate tasks** - Let your AI handle routine user management
- **Learn naturally** - Explore Kinde's API by asking what's possible

## Get started

- Learn about the available [operations and scopes](/mcp-server/about-mcp-server/operations-and-scopes/) that the MCP server provides.
- Read the [setup guide](/mcp-server/get-started/setup-mcp-server/) to get started.
