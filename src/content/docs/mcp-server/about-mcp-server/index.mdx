ai_summary: Overview of the Kinde MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and its capabilities for interacting with Kinde via AI clients
---

The Kinde MCP server allows you to interact with your Kinde account using AI clients like Claude and Cursor using natural language. 

## What is an MCP server?

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server exposes tools, data and functionality for AI agents to use, allowing you to interact with other services in your conversations. 
MCP provides a standardized way for resources such as APIs and databases to be made available to AI models without having to create custom integrations.
Most MCP servers will require either API keys or authentication endpoints in order to authenticate the user interacting with the AI agent.

The Kinde MCP server acts as a bridge between AI assistants and your Kinde account, enabling you to ask questions and perform actions.

## How Kinde Helps

The Kinde MCP Server transforms how developers interact with authentication and user management:

| Benefit | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ⚡ Move faster | Execute Kinde operations without leaving your IDE |
| 🔄 Less context switching | Manage users and permissions with natural language |
| 🤖 Automate tasks | Let your AI handle routine user management |
| 📖 Learn naturally | Explore Kinde's API by asking what's possible |

## What you can do

The Kinde MCP server allows you to interact with your Kinde account using a subset of the features available via the Kinde Management API. You can ask questions and perform actions such as:

- **"What organizations do I have in Kinde?"** 
- **"Does the user john@doe.com exist?"** 
- **"What roles does this user have?"** 
- **"List all users in the default organization"** 

## Available Operations and Scopes



## How it works

- An environment-level API key is set up in Kinde, which forms part of the MCP server configuration that is copied into your AI client.
- Once the configuration is added, the AI client will validate the provided API key, then detect the available tools that the MCP server provides. These tools will be restricted the scopes you defined for the API key.
- When you make requests to the AI client such as 'What organizations do I have in Kinde?', it will look for an appropriate MCP server tool to use for your request.
- The request is sent to the MCP server, which will use your API key to perform actions against the Kinde Management API.
