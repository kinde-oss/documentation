ai_summary: Complete reference guide to all operations and scopes available in the Kinde MCP Server. Learn about user operations (GetUsers, GetUserData), organization operations (GetOrganizations, GetOrganizationUsers), roles and permissions (CreateRole, CreatePermission), and configuration operations (CreateProperty, CreateFeatureFlag). Understand why MCP Server scopes are limited to read and create operations for AI safety.

The MCP Server uses a subset of the scopes available in the [Kinde Management API](/developer-tools/kinde-api/). It exposes the following operations to you:

## Users

<Aside>
  You can only get data for users. You cannot create or update users via the MCP server.
</Aside>

| Operation | Description | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GetUsers | List all users | read:users |
| GetUserData | Get user details | read:users |
| GetUserIdentities | Get linked identity providers | read:user_identities |

## Organizations

<Aside>
  You can only get data for organizations. You cannot create or update organizations with the MCP server.
</Aside>

| Operation | Description | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GetOrganizations | List all organizations | read:organizations |
| GetOrganization | Get organization details | read:organizations |
| GetOrganizationUsers | List users in org | read:organization_users |
| GetOrganizationUserRoles | Get user's roles in org | read:organization_users |
| GetOrganizationUserPermissions | Get user's permissions in org | read:organization_users |
| GetOrganizationFeatureFlags | Get org's feature flags | read:feature_flags |

## Roles & Permissions

| Operation | Description | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GetRoles | List all roles | read:roles |
| GetRole | Get role details | read:roles |
| CreateRole | Create a new role | create:roles |
| GetPermissions | List all permissions | read:permissions |
| CreatePermission | Create a permission | create:permissions |
| GetRolePermissions | Get role's permissions | read:role_permissions |



## Configuration

| Operation | Description | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GetEnvironment | Get environment details | read:environments |
| GetProperties | List custom properties | read:properties |
| CreateProperty | Create a custom property | create:properties |
| CreateFeatureFlag | Create a feature flag | create:feature_flags |
| CreateEnvironmentVariable | Create env variable | create:environment_variables |
| GetSubscribers | List subscribers | read:subscribers |
| CreateSubscriber | Create a subscriber | create:subscribers |

### Why are the MCP Server scopes limited to read and create operations only?

As AI can misinterpret requests or hallucinate, the scopes that the Kinde MCP server can be assigned are currently limited to **gets and creates** only. This ensures that AI clients can query information and create new resources, but cannot modify or delete existing data, providing an additional layer of safety when using AI to interact with your Kinde account. As AI matures, we will be able to expand the scopes with new capabilities.

If you need a broader scope for pragmatic use, check out the [Kinde Management API](/developer-tools/kinde-api/).

### How do I grant scopes to my MCP server?

When creating an Environment API key, select the scopes you want to grant to your API key. Always follow the principle of least privilege when granting API scopes, i.e., only grant access to what's needed.

### How do I check which scopes are enabled for my API key?

You can ask your AI assistant "What tools do you have available from Kinde?" to see the available operations and scopes.
