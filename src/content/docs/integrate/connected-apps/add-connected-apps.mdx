ai-summary: Comprehensive guide to adding and configuring connected apps in Kinde including OAuth setup, scope management, and access token retrieval for third-party integrations.
---

Connected apps let your users access third party tools and services through Kinde. When you add a connection, you’ll need to define which features (or scopes) that you want to be made available.

To get the connection up and running, you’ll need to do some steps in Kinde and some in the app you are connecting.

## **Before you add a connected app**

- Set up a [machine to machine application](/developer-tools/kinde-api/connect-to-kinde-api/)
- Ensure you have at least one [end-user created](/manage-users/add-and-edit/add-and-edit-users/)

## **Step 1: Add the connected app in Kinde**

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Connected apps**.
2. Select **Connect an app**. A dialog opens.
3. Select the connected app you want from the available apps.
4. Select **Save**. The app will appear in the list of your connected apps.
5. Select **Configure** on the tile and copy the **Provider to Kinde** callback URL.
6. Next: Set up the app. See instructions for setting up apps below.

## **Step 2: Set up the app you want to connect**

- [Google Drive](/integrate/connected-apps/google-drive-connected-app/)
- [GitHub](/integrate/connected-apps/github-connected-app/)
- [GitLab](/integrate/connected-apps/gitlab-connected-app/)
- [Patreon](/integrate/connected-apps/patreon-connected-app/)
- [Discord](/integrate/connected-apps/discord-connected-app/)
- [Microsoft 365](/integrate/connected-apps/microsoft-365-connected-app/)

## **Step 3: Configure the connected app in Kinde**

To complete this procedure, you need to have set up the app. See relevant instructions below.

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Connected apps**.
2. On the app tile, select **Configure**.
3. On the Details tab:
   1. Enter a name.
   2. Enter the **Client ID** and **Client secret** from the app, e.g. Google Drive.
   3. Enter a reference key that will be used in your app’s code.
   4. Enter the callback URL for your app.
   5. Select **Save**.
4. In the **Permissions** tab, select the permissions (scopes) that you want to access via the connection.
5. Select **Save**. The next time a user signs in, they will be prompted to allow the above permissions.

## **Step 4: Get an access token via the Kinde Management API**

This final step needs to be performed in your own app, using that app’s language. The steps below simulate the process in Postman.

1. Get the user ID of one of your users by calling the following API in Postman: `https://yourdomain.kinde.com/api/v1/users`. In the below example, the `id` of the only user in the business is `kp:xxxxx...`

  alt=""
  width="672px"
  height="auto"
  fetchpriority="low"
  loading="lazy"
  decoding="async"
/>

    Note: The user’s endpoint is a Kinde management API endpoint, therefore you will need a token to call this API.

2. Using Postman, call the auth url endpoint to get a URL that will allow you to connect, e.g. to Google. The URL is: `https://<KINDE_URL>/api/v1/connected_apps/auth_url?key_code_ref=<KEY>&user_id=<USER_ID>`
3. Replace:

   - `<KINDE_URL>` with your Kinde business url, e.g. `mybiz.kinde.com`
   - `<KEY>` with the unique key you gave your connected app
   - `<USER_ID>` with the user id you got in step 1

   Note: The `auth_url` endpoint is a Kinde management API endpoint, therefore you will need a token to call this API.

   You will get back a URL and session_id in the response if the call was successful:

/>

4. Copy the URL from the call to `url` and paste it in a browser’s address bar. This should redirect you to get authenticated.
5. Authorize the requested scopes for the application. You will be redirected to the URL defined in the `Kinde to application` .
6. Use Postman to call the `connected_apps/token` API to get an access token that has been granted the scopes you have defined previously. The URL is: `https://<KINDE_URL>/api/v1/connected_apps/token?session_id=<SESSION_ID>`
7. Replace:

   - `<KINDE_URL>` with your Kinde business url, e.g. `mybiz.kinde.com`
   - `<SESSION_ID>` with the session_id that was returned when calling the `auth_url` endpoint

   Note: The `connected_apps/token` endpoint is a Kinde management API endpoint, therefore you will need a token.

   You will get an access token back from the call. This token can be used to call the connected services.

8. You’re ready to use the connection. Below is an example API call to Google Drive.

### **Example connected app access - Google Drive**

1. In your code or using Postman, call the Google Drive API to list files. The URL is `https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/files` .
2. You will need to use the access token you obtained earlier, and pass it as a bearer token in the Authorization header. Here’s what the call and return looks like.

## **Disconnect a connected app**

You can disconnect a connected app from Kinde, however this does not revoke permissions. To revoke permissions you need to call the `/connected apps/revoke` endpoint.

1. Go to **Settings > Connected Apps**.
2. Select the three dots menu on the tile for the connected app, then select **Disconnect**. A confirmation window pops up.
3. Select **Disconnect**.
