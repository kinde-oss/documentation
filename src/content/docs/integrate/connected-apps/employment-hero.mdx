You can now set up a connection between Kinde and Employment Hero.

## Before you begin

- Set up a [machine to machine application](/developer-tools/kinde-api/connect-to-kinde-api/)
- Ensure you have at least one [end-user created](/manage-users/add-and-edit/add-and-edit-users/)
- Complete [Step 1: Add a connected app to Kinde](/integrate/connected-apps/add-connected-apps/#step-1-add-the-connected-app-in-kinde)

You also need an [Employment Hero](https://secure.employmenthero.com/) account for creating apps. Here's [their docs](https://developer.employmenthero.com/api-references/#obtain-credentials) to get you started

## Register an Employment Hero app

This is Step 2 of [Add a connected app to Kinde](/integrate/connected-apps/add-connected-apps/#step-2-set-up-the-app-you-want-to-connect).

1. Sign in to your [Employment Hero](https://secure.employmenthero.com/) account.
2. Go to the Developer Portal (under your account profile).
3. Select **Add application**.
4. Enter a name for the app.
5. Enter the **Redirect URI**. This is the **Allowed Callback** URL you have entered in your Kinde app, where users are redirected to after auth.
6. Select the scopes you want to include in the connection.
7. Select **Create**. A Client ID and Client Secret is generated for the app.
8. Copy and paste these in a text file or somewhere you can easily access them again. You’ll use this for the connected app in Kinde.
## Finish configuring the connection in Kinde

You’ll need the **Client ID** and **Secret** that you copied above. 

See [Step 3: Configure the connected app in Kinde](/integrate/connected-apps/add-connected-apps/#step-3-configure-the-connected-app-in-kinde).
