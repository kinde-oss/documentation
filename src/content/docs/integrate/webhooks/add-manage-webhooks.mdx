<Aside type="warning">

If you are experiencing issues with webhooks, it could be because the webhook request content-type header has changed from `application/json` to `application/jwt`. Read the full details [here](https://kinde.notion.site/Important-notice-for-webhooks-users-7fcf184faece41368603e513267dffc6). We apologize for any inconvenience.

</Aside>

Webhooks are outbound calls that are sent from Kinde when a specified events occurs. Calls are sent using HTTPS REST calls to a verified external URL you specify.

Use Kinde’s webhooks to create triggers and push event data to your other systems and applications.

<Aside type="upgrade">

Webhook limits apply if you are on the Kinde free plan. [See all plans](https://kinde.com/pricing/).

## Webhook security

Webhook request payloads are signed and sent as a JSON Web Token (JWT) from Kinde.

You’re probably using a library to validate your JWTs and they will require the url for your public JSON Web Key (also known as a `jwks` file).

The jwks file can be found at `https://<your_subdomain>.kinde.com/.well-known/jwks`

## Add a webhook

1. Go to **Settings > Environment > Webhooks**.
2. Select **Add webhook**.
3. Give the webhook a name and enter a description so it’s clear what it’s for.
4. Enter the external URL.
5. Select the event triggers. You can choose from a number of triggers and categories. See below for definitions.

## Edit a webhook

1. Go to **Settings > Environment > Webhooks**.
2. Select the webhook name to open the details window.
3. Update events and triggers.
4. Select **Save**.

## Delete a webhook

1. Go to **Settings > Environment > Webhooks**.
2. Select the three dots menu next to the webhook you want to delete.
3. Select **Delete webhook**. A confirmation message appears.
4. Confirm you want to delete the webhook.

## Manage webhooks via the Kinde API

Everything you can do in Kinde’s UI with webhooks, you can also do through the Kinde API using these endpoints.

- `POST api/v1/webhooks` - create a webhook
- `PATCH api/v1/webhook/{webhook_id}` - update a webhook
- `DELETE api/v1/webhook/{webhook_id}` - delete a webhook
- `GET api/v1/webhooks` - list of available webhooks

Events can also be retrieved using:

- `GET /api/v1/events/{event_id}` - get an event by the event_id provided in a webhook
- `GET /api/v1/event_types` - list the available event types

## Webhook triggers

Available triggers include:

```jsx
organization.created;
organization.updated;
user.created;
user.updated;
user.deleted;
user.authentication_failed;
user.authenticated;
organization.deleted;
role.created;
role.updated;
role.deleted;
permission.created;
permission.updated;
permission.deleted;
subscriber.created;
access_request.created;
```

<Aside>

The `user.created` trigger does not create a call when you import users

## Testing webhooks locally

In order to use webhooks, you need a publicly available URL. To test locally you need to use a proxy to expose your local instance on the internet.

Here are a couple of free tools to help you to do this.

- [localtunnel](https://theboroer.github.io/localtunnel-www/) - fast and easy, we recommend using the `—subdomain` attribute to fix the issued subdomain.
- [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) - for intermediate users, requires some dev experience to get set up.

Each of these services expose a local port though a public URL that can be set as your web socket.
