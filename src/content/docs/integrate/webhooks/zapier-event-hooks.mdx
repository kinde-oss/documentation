---

This guide will walk you through connecting Kinde webhooks to Zapier, allowing you to automate workflows based on events that occur in your Kinde account. When events like user creation or authentication happen in Kinde, they can trigger automated actions in Zapier.

### What you need

- A [Kinde](https://www.kinde.com/register) account with an available webhook slot (Sign up for free)
- A [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) account (Professional plan or higher required for webhook triggers)
- A [Google account](https://accounts.google.com/) with access to Google Sheets (Sign up for free)

## Step 1: Create a Zap in Zapier

1. Log in to your Zapier account and select **Create** > **Zaps**
2. In the **Trigger** step, search for **Webhooks** and select it.
3. In the **Event** dropdown, select **Catch Raw Hook**, then select **Continue**
   
   <Aside>
   
   **Catch Raw Hook** is required for Kinde webhooks because Kinde sends webhook data as a JWT token string. The raw hook will capture the complete webhook payload including the JWT token.
   
   </Aside>

4. In the **Test** tab, Zapier will generate a unique webhook URL for your Zap. The URL will look like: `https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/1234567/abcdefg/` 

    Copy this URL - you'll need it in the next step.

    Keep this Zap open - you'll return to it after configuring the webhook in Kinde.

## Step 2: Create a webhook in Kinde

1. In your Kinde dashboard, go to **Settings > Webhooks**
2. Select **Add webhook**
3. Give your webhook a descriptive name (e.g., "Kinde Zapier Google Sheets")
4. Enter a description explaining what this webhook is for (e.g., "When user is created")
5. In the **Endpoint URL** field, paste the Zapier webhook URL you copied in Step 1
6. Select **Add event** to select which events you want to trigger this webhook
   
   For this example, select `user.created` to trigger the webhook when a new user is created
   
   Common events you might want to monitor:
   - `user.created` - When a new user signs up
   - `user.updated` - When user information is updated
   - `user.authenticated` - When a user logs in
   - `organization.created` - When a new organization is created
   
   For a complete list of available events, see [Add and manage webhooks](/integrate/webhooks/add-manage-webhooks#webhook-triggers)

7. Select **Save** to create the webhook

## Step 3: Test the webhook trigger

1. In your Kinde dashboard, create a test user to trigger the webhook:
   - Go to **Users** and select **Add user**
   - Enter test user details (e.g., name: "Test User", email: "test@example.com")
   - Select **Save**
2. Return to Zapier and select **Test trigger** in the trigger step
3. You should see the webhook data appear (request A). The data will be a raw JWT token string in the body
4. Select **Continue with selected record** to proceed to the next step
5. Zapier will open a new popup. Search for **Code** and select it

## Step 4: Decode the JWT using Zapier Code action

Since Kinde sends webhook data as a JWT token, you'll need to decode it to access the user information. Zapier's Code action allows you to run JavaScript to decode the JWT.

1. Select **Code by Zapier** and from the Action event dropdown, select **Run JavaScript** as the action. Select **Continue**
2. In the **Input Data** field, add a field called `jwt` and map it to the **Raw Body** from the webhook trigger

3. In the **Code** field, paste the following JavaScript to decode the JWT, replacing the existing code:

    ```javascript
    // Function to decode a JWT token
    function decodeJWT(token) {
      const parts = token.split('.');
      if (parts.length !== 3) {
        throw new Error('Invalid JWT token');
      }
      
      const payload = parts[1].replace(/-/g, '+').replace(/_/g, '/');
      const padded = payload + '='.repeat((4 - (payload.length % 4)) % 4);
      const decoded = JSON.parse(Buffer.from(padded, 'base64').toString('utf-8'));
      return decoded;
    }

    // Get the JWT from input data
    const jwt = inputData.jwt;

    // Decode the JWT
    const decoded = decodeJWT(jwt);

    // Extract user data from the decoded payload
    const userData = decoded.data.user || {};

    // Return the decoded data
    return {
      firstName: userData.first_name || '',
      lastName: userData.last_name || '',
      email: userData.email || '',
      fullName: `${userData.first_name || ''} ${userData.last_name || ''}`.trim(),
      userId: userData.id || '',
      rawData: decoded
    };
    ```

4. Select **Continue**, then **Test step** to verify the JWT is decoded correctly.
5. You should see the decoded user data including first name, last name, and email
6. Select **Publish**

    <Aside>

    The JWT payload structure from Kinde includes a `data` object containing the user information. The Code action extracts fields like `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email` from this data object. See the [webhook payload example](/integrate/webhooks/about-webhooks#example-decoded-payload) for more details.

    </Aside>

## Step 5: Add Google Sheets action

Now that you have decoded the JWT, you can use the extracted data in your Zap action. For this example, we'll add the user to a Google Sheet.

1. In Google Sheets, create a new spreadsheet (e.g. "Kinde Zapier") with the following columns:
   - firstname
   - lastname
   - email

2. In Zapier, edit your Zap and select the plus icon **+** to add another step after the Code action
3. Search for **Google Sheets** and select it
4. From the Action event dropdown select **Create Spreadsheet Row** as the action
5. Connect your Google account and allow permissions to access your Google Sheets. Select **Continue**
6. Select the drive, spreadsheet, and worksheet where you want to add the user data
7. Map the fields by selecting the plus icon **+** next to the fields
   - **firstname**: Use the `First Name` field from the Code step output
   - **lastname**: Use the `Last Name` field from the Code step output
   - **email**: Use the `Email` field from the Code step output

8. Select **Continue**
9. Select **Test step** to see the Google Sheet populated with the user data

10. Select **Publish** to activate your Zap

## Step 6: Test the complete integration

1. In your Kinde dashboard, go to **Users** and select **Add user**
2. Create a new user with a name and email address
3. Select **Save** to create the user
4. The webhook will automatically trigger, sending the user data to Zapier
5. Zapier will decode the JWT, extract the user information, and add it to your Google Sheet
6. Check your Google Sheet to verify the user was added with the correct name and email
7. You can also check Zapier's **Task History** to see if your Zap ran successfully
