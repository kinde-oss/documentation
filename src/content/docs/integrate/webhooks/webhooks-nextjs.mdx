While webhooks will work with any NextJS setup, this guide uses [NextJS 14 with app router](/developer-tools/sdks/backend/nextjs-sdk/) and the `app` directory. You may need to alter some code samples if you have a different setup, but the core instructions remain the same.

## Set up local development

In order to use webhooks, you need a publicly available URL. To test locally you need to use a proxy to expose your local instance on the internet. Here are a couple of free tools to help you to do this.

- [localtunnel](https://theboroer.github.io/localtunnel-www/) - fast and easy, we recommend using the `—subdomain` attribute to fix the issued subdomain.
- [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) - for intermediate users, requires some dev experience to get set up.

Each of these services expose a local port though a public URL that can be set as your web socket. Follow their instructions to run your local NextJS application and you will receive a URL that you need later in this guide.

## Create the Kinde webhook route

Kinde sends webhooks as JWT’s to make them both easy and secure. In this example we will leverage 2 libraries to parse the JWT and verify the signature.

1. Create the file `app/api/kinde-webhook/route.ts`. The `route.ts` file is a specific file convention in NextJS that marks the route as an API route, rather than a page.

   ```jsx
   // app/api/kinde-webhook/route.ts

   import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

   export async function POST(req: Request) {
     return NextResponse.json({ status: 200, statusText: "success" });
   }
   ```

   Whenever an event occurs in Kinde, a POST request is sent via this route to the specified endpoint, so that your project can react to the event. For example, refreshing a token or updating data in your database.

   Note that the endpoint needs to be publicly available, with no route protection.

2. Install the dependencies.

   ```bash
   #npm
   npm i jwks-rsa jsonwebtoken
   #yarn
   yarn add jwks-rsa jsonwebtoken
   #pnpm
   pnpm i jwks-rsa jsonwebtoken
   ```

3. Update your file as follows:

   ```jsx
   // app/api/kinde-webhook/route.ts

   import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
   import jwksClient from "jwks-rsa";
   import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";

   // The Kinde issuer URL should already be in your `.env` file
   // from when you initially set up Kinde. This will fetch your
   // public JSON web keys file
   const client = jwksClient({
     jwksUri: `${process.env.KINDE_ISSUER_URL}/.well-known/jwks.json`,
   });

   export async function POST(req: Request) {
     try {
   		// Get the token from the request
       const token = await req.text();

       // Decode the token
       const { header } = jwt.decode(token, { complete: true });
       const { kid } = header;

   		// Verify the token
       const key = await client.getSigningKey(kid);
       const signingKey = key.getPublicKey();
       const event = await jwt.verify(token, signingKey);

   		// Handle various events
       switch (event?.type) {
         case "user.updated":
           // handle user updated event
   				// e.g update database with event.data
   				console.log(event.data);
           break;
         case "user.created":
           // handle user created event
   				// e.g add user to database with event.data
   				console.log(event.data);
           break;
         default:
           // other events that we don't handle
           break;
       }

     } catch (err) {
       if (err instanceof Error) {
         console.error(err.message);
         return NextResponse.json({ message: err.message }, { status: 400 });
       }
     }
     return NextResponse.json({ status: 200, statusText: "success" });
   }
   ```

   As per the sample above, the JWKs file is fetched from Kinde, the token is decoded, and the signature is compared against your keys file. This is how you know you can trust the request has come from Kinde.

   > 💡 **Handling different event types**. In the example above, we used a switch statement. But you could also set up an endpoint per event type, group them into related endpoints, use a map, or any other method for splitting and managing the events.

4. Start your server so it’s ready and listening out for the next step. With most NextJS applications, run `npm run dev` in the terminal.

## Set up the webhook in Kinde

1. In the Kinde, go to **Settings > Environment > Webhooks**.
2. Select **Add webhook**.
3. Give the webhook a name and description.
4. Enter the NextJS endpoint we set up earlier in your project. For example `<your_app_url>/api/kinde-webhook`. If you are using an external tool to test the endpoint locally, enter the endpoint URL specified in the tool.

   > ⚠️ Make sure URLs match. Testing will fail if the endpoint URL in Kinde does not match the site URL where you are testing the webhook.

5. Select **Add events.**
6. In the dialog that opens, select the events you want. For example, user events, organization events, etc.
7. Select **Save**.
8. In the webhook window, select **Save**.

## Test the webhook

1. Either create a new user or update an existing one in Kinde.
2. Switch back to where your server is running and you should see the data in your server console.
3. Done! Have a tasty beverage.
