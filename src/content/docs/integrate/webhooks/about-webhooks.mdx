<Aside type="warning">

If you are experiencing issues with webhooks, it could be because the webhooks request content-type header has changed from `application/json` to `application/jwt`. Read the full details [here](https://kinde.notion.site/Important-notice-for-webhooks-users-7fcf184faece41368603e513267dffc6). We apologize for any inconvenience.

</Aside>

Webhooks are a way of monitoring events in Kinde, so that you can be notified and take action when something you’re monitoring happens.

<Aside type="upgrade">

Depending which Kinde plan you’re on, the number of webhooks you can create might be limited. [View plans](https://kinde.com/pricing/).

## How webhooks work

When you create a webhook, you register your own URL endpoints in Kinde and associate them with a Kinde event (e.g. when a user is created). When an endpoint is triggered, Kinde sends data about the event, so that you can initiate an action in your application or store the data.

A simple example would be setting up a webhook for when a new user is created in Kinde. This event can be set up to trigger an update to your database, enabling your system to automatically send a welcome email.

## Webhooks flow

1. Webhook endpoints are registered in Kinde.
2. An event occurs in your account, e.g. `user.created`.
3. Your endpoint will be called with a JWT containing the data object about that event, and details about the webhook.
   1. If a `200` response is received, the workflow is complete.
   2. If it fails to receive a response, it will retry using a back-off policy (see **Webhooks responses and retry policy** below).
4. In your application you should verify the authenticity of the webhook request, and decode the JWT (see **Webhooks security** below).
5. Logic is triggered in your application using the event data.

## Webhooks identifiers

There are a number of unique IDs you will come across with webhooks.

- **Webhook ID**: prefixed with `webhook_`, this refers to the webhooks that you create in Kinde. Webhook IDs are exposed via the Kinde Management API webhook endpoints. You can get a list of webhooks via the endpoint `GET /api/v1/webhooks`
- **Event ID**: prefixed with `event_`, this is the ID of an event that has occurred in your account, and is included as `event_id` in webhook request payloads. You can use this ID to retrieve an event from Kinde’s API using `GET /api/v1/events/{event_id}`
- **Webhook Request ID**: found in the webhook headers as `webhook-id`, this is unique to a webhook and event, and will not change between attempts. You can use this as the idempotency key (see Webhooks security below).

## Webhooks decoder

Kinde provides a [webhooks decoder](https://github.com/kinde-oss/webhook) to help you decode and validate webhook tokens, for an easier implementation.

## Webhooks security

### Idempotency key

Each webhook has a webhook-id header that can be used to avoid reprocessing the same webhook request. This is referred to as the ‘idempotency key’ meaning that multiple requests will result in the same outcome.

### Prevent Replay Attacks

A replay attack occurs when a payload is intercepted, potentially modified and re-transmitted. Kinde webhooks contain a ‘timestamp’ attribute in the payload, and the payload is a signed JSON Web Token (JWT). This allows you to verify that the request came from Kinde, and check the timestamp to prevent replay attacks.

### Verify an event

You can request events by their event_id using the Kinde management api via `/api/v1/events/{event_id}`. The event_id is provided in all webhook requests.

## Webhooks best practices

Ensure webhooks are secure and optimized.

- Handle duplicate request attempts by checking that the webhook-id header has not already been received and processed, making your processing idempotent
- Verify the JWT to ensure that the request came from Kinde using your public JWKS file
- Only add the events to your endpoint that your implementation requires, listening for all events creates unnecessary load on your server
- Endpoints must use HTTPS
- Return a 200 from your endpoint to indicate it has received the request

## Webhooks responses and retry policy

If we fail to receive a 200 response from your endpoint, Kinde operates a back-off retry policy, this roughly equates to the following attempts:

- Immediately
- After 5 seconds
- After 30 seconds
- After 2 minutes
- After 10 minutes
- After 1 hour
- After 4 hours
- Every 12 hours until 36 hours

## Webhooks terminology

You’ll come across these terms when you start using webhooks.

**Endpoint** - the URL called when an event occurs.

**Event type** - something that happens in Kinde, e.g. a user is created.

**Event** - an instance of an event type that happens in Kinde, e.g. Jane Doe just signed up.

**Request** - the request object sent to your endpoint that contains a JSON Web Token (JWT) with the event data and details about the event.

**Attempt** - an instance of a request making an http request, multiple request attempts may be made if we do not receive a 200 response.
