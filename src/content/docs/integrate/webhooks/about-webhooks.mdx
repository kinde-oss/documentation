<Aside type="warning">

If you are experiencing issues with webhooks, it could be because the webhook request content-type header has changed from `application/json` to `application/jwt`. Read the full details [here](https://kinde.notion.site/Important-notice-for-webhooks-users-7fcf184faece41368603e513267dffc6). We apologize for any inconvenience.

</Aside>

Webhooks are a way of monitoring events in Kinde, so that you can be notified and take action when something you’re monitoring happens.

<Aside type="upgrade">

Depending on which Kinde plan you’re on, the number of webhooks you can create might be limited. [View plans](https://kinde.com/pricing/).

## How webhooks work

When you create a webhook, you register your own URL endpoints in Kinde and associate them with a Kinde event (e.g. when a user is created). When an endpoint is triggered, Kinde sends data about the event, so that you can initiate an action in your application or store the data.

A simple example would be setting up a webhook for when a new user is created in Kinde. This event can be set up to trigger an update to your database, enabling your system to automatically send a welcome email.

## Webhooks terminology

You’ll come across these terms when you start using webhooks.

**Endpoint** - the URL called when an event occurs.

**Event type** - something that happens in Kinde, e.g. a user is created.

**Event** - an instance of an event type that happens in Kinde, e.g. Jane Doe just signed up.

**Request** - the request object sent to your endpoint that contains a JSON Web Token (JWT) with the event data and details about the event.

**Attempt** - an instance of an HTTP request attempt. Multiple request attempts may be made if Kinde does not receive a 200 response.


## Webhooks flow

1. Webhook endpoints are registered in Kinde.
2. An event occurs in your account, e.g. `user.created`.
3. Your endpoint will be called with a JWT containing the data object about that event, and details about the webhook.
   1. If a `200` response is received, the workflow is complete.
   2. If Kinde fails to receive a response, it will retry using a back-off policy (see **Webhooks responses and retry policy** below).
4. In your application you should verify the authenticity of the webhook request, and decode the JWT (see **Webhooks security** below).
5. Logic is triggered in your application using the event data.

## Webhook request content-type

Kinde uses the `application/jwt` content-type for webhook requests.

The body of the request is a JWT token that is signed by Kinde.

```text
eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjJhOmUwOjRmO...
```

### Example decoded payload

Here is an example decoded payload.

You can use the [Kinde webhook package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kinde/webhooks) to decode and verify the JWT. You can also use the [Kinde Online JWT decoder](https://www.kinde.com/tools/online-jwt-decoder/) to view it online.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "first_name": "Test",
      "id": "kp_1234567890",
      "is_password_reset_requested": false,
      "is_suspended": false,
      "last_name": "",
      "organizations": [
        {
          "code": "org_1234567890",
          "permissions": null,
          "roles": null
        }
      ],
      "phone": null,
      "username": null
    }
  },
  "event_id": "event_1234567890",
  "event_timestamp": "2026-02-03T12:00:00.000Z",
  "source": "admin",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-03T12:00:00.000Z",
  "type": "user.created"
}
```

## Webhooks identifiers

There are a number of unique IDs you will come across with webhooks.

- **Webhook ID**: prefixed with `webhook_`, this refers to a webhook that you create in Kinde. Webhook IDs are exposed via the Kinde Management API webhook endpoints. You can get a list of webhooks via the endpoint `GET /api/v1/webhooks`
- **Event ID**: prefixed with `event_`, this is the ID of an event that has occurred in your account, and is included as `event_id` in webhook request payloads. You can use this ID to retrieve an event from Kinde’s API using `GET /api/v1/events/{event_id}`
- **Webhook Request ID**: found in webhook request headers as `webhook-id`, this is unique to a webhook and event, and will not change between attempts. You can use this as the idempotency key (see Webhooks security below).

## Webhooks decoder

Kinde provides a [webhooks decoder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kinde/webhooks) to help you decode and validate webhook tokens for easier implementation.

Here's how to use it in a JavaScript application:

```javascript
import { decodeWebhook } from "@kinde/webhooks";

const decodedToken = await decodeWebhook(
  "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjJhOmUwOjRmO...",
  "https://your-kinde-subdomain.kinde.com"); // KINDE_ISSUER_URL

if(!decodedToken) { 
  // return early if the webhook is not valid
  return;
 }

if(decodedToken.type === "user.created") {
  // handle user created event
}
```

## Webhooks security

### Idempotency key

Each webhook request has a `webhook-id` header that can be used to avoid reprocessing the same webhook request. This is referred to as the **idempotency key**, meaning that multiple requests will result in the same outcome.

### Prevent Replay Attacks

A replay attack occurs when a payload is intercepted, potentially modified, and re-transmitted. Kinde webhooks contain a `timestamp` attribute in the payload, and the payload is a signed JSON Web Token (JWT). This allows you to verify that the request came from Kinde, and check the `timestamp` to prevent replay attacks.

### Verify an event

You can request events by their `event_id` using the Kinde Management API via `/api/v1/events/{event_id}`. The `event_id` is provided in all webhook requests.

## Webhooks best practices

Ensure webhooks are secure and optimized.

- Handle duplicate request attempts by checking that the webhook-id header has not already been received and processed, making your processing idempotent
- Verify the JWT to ensure that the request came from Kinde using your public JWKS file
- Only subscribe to the events that your implementation requires; listening for all events creates unnecessary load on your server
- Endpoints must use HTTPS
- Return a 200 from your endpoint to indicate it has received the request

## Webhooks responses and retry policy

If Kinde fails to receive a 200 response from your endpoint, Kinde operates a back-off retry policy, which roughly equates to the following attempts:

- Immediately
- After 5 seconds
- After 30 seconds
- After 2 minutes
- After 10 minutes
- After 1 hour
- After 4 hours
- Every 12 hours until 36 hours

## Webhooks auto-disable policy

Webhooks that fail consistently for 72 hours are automatically disabled, and you’ll receive an email notification when this happens. This prevents runaway failures from impacting your system and keeps you informed so you can investigate and re-enable when ready.

## Next steps

Now that you know about webhooks, your next steps are to:
