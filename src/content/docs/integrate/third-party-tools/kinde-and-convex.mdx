ai_summary: Integrate Kinde with Convex to enable real-time user data sync and secure authentication with Kinde access tokens.
---

Bring real-time interactivity to your app with Convex, a powerful Backend-as-a-Service designed for dynamic React experiences.

Now, with Kinde webhooks, you can seamlessly sync user data from Kinde into your Convex database. This allows you to authenticate queries and mutations in Convex using access tokens generated by Kinde Auth.

Convex and Kinde work great together—this guide shows you how to connect them using webhooks so that your data stays in sync and your app stays secure.

### What you need

- A [Kinde](https://kinde.com/) account (Sign up for free)
- A [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) account (Sign up for free)

## Step 1: Set up your Kinde application

1. Sign in to Kinde and select **Add application**.
2. In the dialog that opens, enter a name for the application (e.g., Kinde & Convex).
3. Choose **Front-end and mobile** as the application type, and select **Save**.
4. On the **Quickstart** page, select **React** and then select **Save**.
5. Select **Set** for both the **Set callback URL**, and **Set logout URL**. 

    ![kinde callback urls](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/d5d0489d-019f-488d-ecaa-b08f4d2e5800/public)

6. Go to **Authentication** in the menu and select the **Social connections** you want to enable for your application (e.g., Google) and select **Save**.
7. From the Kinde home page, select **Settings** > **APIs** > **Add API**. 
8. Type a name for the API (e.g., Convex)
9. Enter `convex` in the **Audience** field and select **Save**. This will enable the Convex backend to connect with your Kinde application.
    
    ![kinde add api](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/b495752c-4589-48b2-d105-23a8a189a300/public)
    
10. From the Kinde home screen, select **View details** on your Convex application.
    ![view application details](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/f42d7fd1-075a-4221-8b20-c398db370900/public)
    
    
11. Go to **APIs**, you will see the Convex API you created earlier.
12. Select the **three dots** next to your Convex API and select **Authorize application**.
    
    This will add `convex` into your Kinde JSON web token inside the `aud` field. It will allow convex to authorize a user using Kinde.
    
    ![authorize application](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/08c88f1b-6f4d-4937-f430-b7743a28df00/public)
    

## Step 2: Set up your Convex project

1. Clone or download the [Kinde Convex Auth starter kit from GitHub](https://github.com/tamalchowdhury/kinde-convex-auth) using the following bash command:
    
    This will generate a starter React Convex project with sample schema and route files included.
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tamalchowdhury/kinde-convex-auth.git
    ```
    
2. Change into the project directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd kinde-convex-auth
    ```
    
3. Install the project dependencies:
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
4. Create a `.env` file with the bash command:
    
    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```
    
5. Open the `.env` file with your preferred code editor, and enter the variables found on **Kinde > Kinde & Convex** (your application) **> Quick Start** page.

    ![update environment variables](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/6cf8cb14-3df0-4042-5fda-a3d317623d00/public)

6. Run the following command in your terminal. This will prompt you to log into your Convex account and walk you through setting up the project.
    
    ```bash
    npx convex dev
    ```
    
7. If you see an env variable error, it means you need to add your Kinde domain as the `VITE_KINDE_DOMAIN` in Convex.

    ![convex env variable error](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/7e6016cf-fc5b-43b0-d35e-cb3201f99800/public)

8. Go to your **Convex dashboard > Project > Settings > Environment Variables.**
9. Set the `VITE_KINDE_DOMAIN` using the credentials from your Kinde **Quick start** page.
    
    
    ![convex setup environment variable](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/e48a3c7a-9930-481e-472b-71ceea5ab300/public)
    
10. After the set up is complete, you should see green checkmarks in your terminal. Keep this Convex development running in the background to continue working with your project locally.

## Step 3: Set up the Kinde webhook

Your Convex project creates a custom endpoint under the `/kinde-users-webhook` route. If you open the `/convex/http.ts` file, you can see a new route definition for your Convex backend. 

This endpoint will be listening for an incoming `POST` request from Kinde.

1. Go to your **Convex dashboard > Project > Settings > URL & Deploy Key.**
2. Select **Show development credentials** and copy the **HTTP Actions URL.**
    
    ![convex show development credentials page](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/d69caa08-07a1-443b-fd42-414208807e00/public)
    
3. In Kinde Home, go to **Settings > Webhooks.** 
4. Select **Add webhook**. 
5. Enter the webhook **Name** and description
6. Add the **Endpoint URL.** This is the **HTTP Actions URL** you copied in Convex: `https://your_convex_subdomain.convex.site/kinde-users-webhook`
    
    ![kinde add webhook endpoint](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/0e197529-2e6f-4f68-4f3e-3147a71e2000/public)
    
7. Scroll down and select **Add event**. 
8. Select all the user-specific events your application will listen for, and select **Save**.
    
    ![kinde add events in webhook](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/dd6ab394-a797-4a43-5152-61c995991d00/public)
    
9. Select **Save** on the webhook creation page to finish creating the webhook.

## Step 4: Test your Convex application

1. Open a new terminal window, but keep the Convex dev server running in the first one.
2. Enter the following command to run the Vite project.
    
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    
3. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and sign in or create a new account.
    
    Each time a new user signs up or signs in to your application:
    
    - a webhook fires from Kinde to your Convex backend with the user ID.
    - Convex backend stores the user in the database with the `upsertFromKinde` handler in the `/convex/users.ts` file.
    
    You can find it in Convex, in the **Convex dashboard > Data >  users** table.
    
    ![convex users database](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/6f14730c-720b-4b87-1c4b-3dd8aabd4200/public)
    
4. Enter a task and select **send**. You will see the task show up in your application.
    
    ![kinde react demo application](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/f6851728-3dd3-4b0b-9479-efaa3230a700/public)
    

### The Kinde and Convex webhook result

- The task is saved to the Convex database using the `send` handler in `/convex/tasks.ts` file.
- The React client page calls the database using the `get` handler of `/convex/tasks.ts` using the `useQuery` hook in `/src/components/Tasks.tsx` file.

This happens in real-time thanks to Convex sync.

You can see the tasks in **Convex Dashboard > Database > tasks** table.

### You have done it 🎉

With webhooks in place, your Kinde user data is now automatically synced to your Convex database. This gives your application fast, secure access to user information while avoiding common performance issues like n+1 queries. It also ensures your UI stays responsive to real-time data updates.

Webhooks offer a flexible way to extend Kinde’s authentication and user management into your backend workflows, so you can work with the tools you already use while keeping everything connected.

Follow best practices, test your integration carefully, keep your dependencies up to date, and monitor for any security advisories to ensure everything runs smoothly.
