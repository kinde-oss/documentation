To support the delivery of our services, Kinde may engage and use data processors (each, a “sub-processor“) with possible access to external user and customer personal data that is uploaded, accessed, processed, or transmitted to and from our services. This page provides important information about the identity, location, and role of each sub-processor.

## Sub-Processors for external users

External users are customers of Kinde’s customers.

Notifications of changes to sub-processors for external users will be provided to customers who have signed a Data Processing Agreement (DPA). If you need a DPA, please reach out to our team at support@kinde.com.

The sub-processors for external users used will depend on the features and integrations in use.
