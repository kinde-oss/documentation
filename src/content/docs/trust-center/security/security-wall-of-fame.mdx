Kinde sends out huge thanks and massive props to the security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities that help secure our systems.

The list also includes testers who take part in our security challenges each year.

Everyone listed on this page has submitted one or more valid vulnerabilities, and they consented to their information being published.

Love your work!
