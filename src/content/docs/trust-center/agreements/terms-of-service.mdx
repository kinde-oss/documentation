   4. All personal information you and your Authorized Users provide to us will be treated in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
   5. You agree to provide and maintain up to date information in your Account and to not share your Account password with any other person. Your Account is personal and you must not transfer or provide it to others with the exception of your Authorized Users.
   6. You are responsible for keeping your Account details and your username and password confidential and you will be liable for all activity on your Account, including purchases made using your Account details, and any activity from one of your Authorized Users. Each Authorized User is responsible for keeping their login details confidential. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your Account.
   7. When you create an Account, you will automatically be provided with a subscription (**Subscription**). You may choose between different tiers of Subscription with different services and different Subscription periods as set out on our Platform.
6. **Email Communication**
   1. All users subscribing to our Platform are required to provide a valid and active email address for communication purposes. It is your responsibility to ensure that the email address associated with your account is kept current and accessible. Our Platform relies on email as the primary mode of communication for sending important notifications, updates, billing invoices, and support-related correspondence. Failure to receive such communications due to an incorrect or inaccessible email address can lead to disruptions in service or important missed notifications.
   2. If, for any reason, you becomes uncontactable via the email address provided, or if we receive bounce-backs, auto-responses, or any other indications that an email has not been successfully delivered, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your Subscription to our Platform, at our sole discretion.
   3. Before any such action is taken, we will make reasonable attempts to contact you to rectify the situation. However, if these attempts are unsuccessful and we are unable to establish contact via email within a reasonable timeframe, suspension or termination may be enacted.
7. **Authorized Users**
   1. If set out in your Account, you may be permitted to invite a number of users to the Platform, who will be permitted to access and use the Platform under your Account (**Authorized Users**). We agree to provide you with the number of Authorized Users as set out in your Account.
   2. The Authorized Users will have permission to access certain features of the Platform and your Account, as detailed in your Account and you may adjust these permission settings in your Account.
   3. You will ensure that each Authorized User complies with these Terms and our End User Licence Agreement. You are responsible and liable for the acts or omissions of your Authorized Users.
   4. Each Authorized User must agree to our End User Licence Agreement (as available on our website) in order to access the Platform.
8. **Subscriptions**
   1. Your Subscription will last for the period specified in your Account. We will charge your chosen payment method for the Subscription you have chosen and its corresponding Subscription fee (**Subscription Fees**) and usage fee (**Usage Fee**) on the day set out in your Account (**Payment Date**), or as communicated in writing to you.
   2. The fee structure for our Platform consists of three distinct components: a Subscription Fee, a Usage Fee and a Transaction Fee. The Subscription Fee is a fixed charge applicable to all users for access to our Platform. This Subscription Fee is charged separately and is independent of the Usage Fee. The Usage Fee is a variable charge that is based on the actual utilisation of specific features or services on our platform. The calculation of the Usage Fee depends on the nature and extent of your activity, such as the number of transactions performed, the volume of data processed, the number of users added, or the duration and frequency of use of certain services. The Transaction Fee is a charge to users of the Platform billing product that facilitates end customer transactions. We may bill the Transaction Fee either: (i) on a monthly basis; or (ii) at the time the end customer transaction is made, depending on our billing provider.
   3. Unless your Subscription is suspended or terminated in accordance with these Terms, your Subscription will roll over on an ongoing monthly basis, and you will be charged the same Subscription Fees on an ongoing monthly basis from the Payment Date. Without limiting your rights under the Australian Consumer Law, you can cancel your Subscription at any time in accordance with the “Cancellation of Subscriptions” clause of these Terms but the cancellation will only have effect from expiry of the monthly period for which you have paid the Subscription Fees and Usage Fees.
   4. The payment methods we offer for the Subscription Fees and Usage Fees are set out on the Platform. We may offer payment through a third-party provider. You acknowledge and agree that we have no control over the actions of the third-party provider, and your use of the third-party payment method may be subject to additional terms and conditions.
   5. You must not pay, or attempt to pay, the Subscription Fees and Usage Fees by fraudulent or unlawful means. If you make a payment by debit card or credit card, you warrant that you are authorized to use the debit card or credit card to make the payment.
   6. You agree that we may set-off or deduct from any monies payable to you under these Terms, any amounts which are payable by you to us (whether under these Terms or otherwise).
   7. Changes to your Subscription: If you wish to suspend or change your Subscription (for example, by upgrading to a different Subscription tier), you must provide notice to us through support channels or via email that you wish to suspend or vary your Subscription at least 7 days before the next Payment Date. If you vary your Subscription and the Subscription Fees increase, the increased Subscription Fees will apply on the next Payment Date, and you will have access to the additional Subscription features on the next Payment Date. If you vary your Subscription and the Subscription Fees decrease, the decreased Fees will apply on the next Payment Date, and you will lose access to the additional Subscription features on the next Payment Date.
   8. Our pricing model does not incorporate any charges based on the number of team members or users associated with your Subscription and fees associated with usage are charged separately from the Subscription Fee as a Usage Fee, subject to clause 8(c).
   9. To the extent permitted by law, the Subscription Fees and Usage Fees are non-refundable and non-cancellable once paid to cover our estimated losses resulting from the cost of resources spent in providing your our Platform and support services.
   10. We may need to change what is available as part of your Subscription (for example, any plan change or feature removal) from time to time. If we change what is available as part of your Subscription, we will provide you with 30 days’ notice of the change. After 30 days, we will apply the changes to your Subscription. If the changes substantially and adversely affect your enjoyment of the Subscription, you may cancel your Subscription in accordance with the ‘Cancelling Subscriptions’ clause. If the changes are to your benefit, we will be deploying those new features and adjustments continuously at our discretion.
   11. We may need to change the Subscription Fees from time to time. If we change the Subscription Fees, we will provide you with 30 days’ notice of the change. After 30 days, we may apply the updated Subscription Fee to your Subscription. If the updated Subscription Fee is not acceptable to you, you may cancel your Subscription in accordance with the ‘Cancelling Subscriptions’ clause.
9. **Beta Services**
   1. For the purposes of this clause:
      1. “**Beta Services**” means any services, software or functionality provided by us that are not generally available to customers and which are designated as beta, pilot, limited release, developer preview, non-production, evaluation, or by a similar description.
