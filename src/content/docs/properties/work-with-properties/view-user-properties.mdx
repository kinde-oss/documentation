If you use properties to manage user data, you can edit the property values manually in Kinde or [via API](/kinde-apis/management#tag/users/patch/api/v1/users/{user_id}/properties).

## View the properties of a user

1. In Kinde, go to **Users**.
2. Browse or search, and select the user who’s properties you want to view.
3. Select **Properties**.

## Edit property values for a user

1. In Kinde, go to **Users**.
2. Browse or search, and select the user who’s properties you want to view.
3. Select **Properties**.
4. Select **Edit** next to the property you want to change.
5. In the window that opens, enter or edit the value.
6. Select **Save**.

## Manage user properties via API

You can also manage user properties via the [Kinde Management API](/kinde-apis/management#tag/users/patch/api/v1/users/{user_id}/properties).
