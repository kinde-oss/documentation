For properties to be available in an application, user or organization record, they first need to exist in your business. This topic describes how to create and edit properties.

## Add a property

You can also create and update properties through the [Kinde Management API](https://kinde.com/api/docs/#kinde-management-api-properties).

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings** **> Data management > Properties**.
2. Select **Add Property**.

  width="672px"
  height="auto"
  fetchpriority="low"
  loading="lazy"
  decoding="async"
/>

3. Enter a **Name** for the property.
4. (Optional) Add a short description. Note that this description will appear when someone goes to edit the value of a property in a User or Organization record.
5. Assign a **Key** to the property. This needs to be unique so that you can identify it in your code. The key cannot be changed later. Note that any Kinde included properties start with `kp-`.
6. Select if the property needs to remain **Private**. If you switch this off, the property can be selected to be included in tokens. See [Add and manage properties in tokens](/properties/work-with-properties/properties-in-tokens/).

7. Select if the property is for **Users**, **Applications**, or **Organizations**.
8. Select a **Category**. Use an existing one or create your own, see [Create property categories](/properties/work-with-properties/property-groups/).
9. Select the **Property type**. You can choose from Boolean, single line text, or multi line text. For more information, see below.
10. Select **Save**.

## How to choose a property type

- Boolean: For when you want to indicate a true or false status, e.g. `paid_membership="true"`
- Single line text: For including a short piece of info in a property, e.g. `membership_type="bronze"`
- Multi line text: For including more substantial information, e.g. an address or business description.

## Add properties as custom claims in tokens

One of the powers of properties is being able to use them to include custom claims in tokens. To ensure a token is usable in tokens, make sure it is set to **Public** at step 6, above.

## Edit a property

You can change the name and some property settings, but not all attributes can be edited. For example, you cannot change the property key once it has been created.

<Aside type="warning">

Take care changing the availability of a property to be included in tokens, such as switching a property from public to private. This could cause a breaking change if the property is already used in tokens. See [Add and manage properties in tokens](/properties/work-with-properties/properties-in-tokens/).

</Aside>

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings** **> Data management > Properties**.
2. Search or scroll for the property you want and select the three dots next to the property.
3. Choose **Edit property**.
4. Make the changes you want and select **Save**.
