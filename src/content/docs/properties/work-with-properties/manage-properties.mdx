For properties to be available in a user or organization record, they first need to exist in your business. This topic describes how to create and edit properties.

You can also create and manage properties through the [Kinde Management API](https://kinde.com/api/docs/#kinde-management-api-properties).

## Add a property

You can add properties directly in Kinde, or via API.

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings** **> Data management > Properties**.
2. Select **Add Property**.

  alt=""
  width="672px"
  height="auto"
  fetchpriority="low"
  loading="lazy"
  decoding="async"
/>

3. In the **Add property** window:
   1. Enter a **Name** for the property.
   2. (Optional) Add a short description. Note that this description will appear when someone goes to edit the value of a property in a User or Organization record.
   3. Assign a **Key** to the property. This needs to be unique so that you can identify it in your code. The key cannot be changed later. Note that any Kinde included properties start with `kp-`.
   4. Select whether the property needs to remain **Private**. If you switch this off, the property can be selected to be included in tokens. See [Add and manage properties in tokens](/properties/work-with-properties/properties-in-tokens/).
   5. Select if the property is for **User** or **Organization** information.
   6. Select a **Property category**. Use an existing one or create your own, see [Create property categories](/properties/work-with-properties/property-groups/).
4. Select the field format.
5. Select **Save**.

## Edit a property

You can change the name and some property settings, but not all attributes can be edited. For example, you cannot change the property key.

<Aside type="warning">

Take care changing the availability of a property to be included in tokens, such as switching a property from public to private. This could cause a breaking change if the property is already used in tokens. See [Add and manage properties in tokens](/properties/work-with-properties/properties-in-tokens/).

</Aside>

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings** **> Data management > Properties**.
2. Search or scroll for the property you want and select the three dots next to the property.
3. Choose **Edit property**.
4. Make the changes you want and select **Save**.
