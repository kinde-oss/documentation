You can select what information to include in a token for each of your applications. Before you can add properties to tokens, they need to be set to ‘public’ in the property settings. See [Add and manage properties](/properties/work-with-properties/manage-properties/).

You can edit **Access tokens** and **ID tokens** for front-end and back-end apps. You cannot add properties to tokens for M2M apps. 

## Add properties to tokens

2. Select **Tokens**.
3. Scroll to the **Token customization** section.
4. Select **Customize** on the relevant token type. The **Customize [access/ID/M2M] token** dialog opens.
5. Select the **Properties** you want to add. These will be included in the token.
6. Select **Save**.

## Edit or remove properties from tokens

1. Open the relevant application. On the **Home** screen or in **Settings > Applications,** select **View details** on your application.
