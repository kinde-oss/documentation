If you use properties to manage application data, you can edit property values manually in Kinde or via API. For example, you might want to associate an application with a specific internal ID to reference your systems.

## View the properties of an application

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Applications**.
2. Select **View details** on the application whose properties you want to view.
3. Select **Properties**.

## Edit property values for an application

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Applications**.
2. Select **View details** on the application whose properties you want to view.
3. Select **Properties**.
4. Select **Edit** next to the property you want to update.
5. In the window that opens, enter or edit the value.
6. Select **Save**.

## Manage properties via API

You can also manage application properties via the [Kinde Management API](/kinde-apis/management#tag/properties).
