Roles and permissions are defined at the business level, but set at the level of an **Organization**. So if you have users who belong to multiple organizations, you’ll need to set their roles and permissions separately.

You can add and remove roles and permissions for users in an organization. If you can’t find a role or permission, you may need to add it. See [Define user permissions](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/user-permissions/) and [Define user roles](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/user-roles/).

You can also assign roles and permissions to users by [updating their profiles in bulk](/manage-users/add-and-edit/import-users-in-bulk/).

## **Apply and edit roles and permissions**

Roles and permissions cannot be assigned to a user unless they belong to an organization.
