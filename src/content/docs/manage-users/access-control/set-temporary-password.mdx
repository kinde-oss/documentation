If you have set up [password authentication](/authenticate/authentication-methods/password-authentication/) for your users, you might want to set or update their password. Kinde lets you set a single-use, temporary password to enable authentication. There are a number of reasons why you might need to do this, for example:

- You don’t allow self-sign-up, so you provide sign in and password details to all new users
- You don’t have a valid email for the user
- The user cannot access their email or phone, to receive a reset password code

When you set a temporary password, you’ll need to communicate it to the user via your own method. Kinde cannot send a temporary password via email or SMS.

## Security warning

Setting a temporary password is not a very secure way of helping a user sign in. The password might be overheard or intercepted after you send it, and it could be misused and make your systems vulnerable.

If you have an email for the user, we recommend triggering a [password reset](/manage-users/access-control/reset-user-password/) instead.

## Signing in with a temporary password

To use a temporary password, the user signs in with their email, or other identity credential, and uses the temporary password. They will be immediately prompted to set a new password of their own creation. Once used, the temporary password becomes invalid.

## Set a temporary password in Kinde

1. In Kinde, go to **Users**, then open the profile of the user.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page to the **Admin actions** section.
3. In the **Manage passwords** area, select **Set temporary password**.
4. In the window that appears, enter a password.

   <Aside>

   The password must be more than 8 characters, not common or guessable (e.g. not `Password123`). We recommend a mix of alphanumeric characters in upper and lowercase. Special characters are optional.

   </Aside>

5. To view the password, select the ‘eye’ icon.
6. Select **Set temporary password**.
7. Communicate the password to the user.

## Set or update a password via Kinde API

The [Set user ](https://kinde.com/api/docs/#set-user-password)[password ](https://kinde.com/api/docs/#set-user-password)[API](https://kinde.com/api/docs/#set-user-password) allows you to supply a hashed password for a user. If you pass the `is_temporary_password: true` to the API it will set a password as being single-use.

<Aside type="warning">

We only accept password hashes and will never allow plain text passwords

</Aside>

Include the following information for the password API:

- `hashed_password` - the user’s password encrypted using a hashing method or algorithm
- `hashing_method` - the name of the algorithm used to encrypt the user’s password. Currently **crypt**, **bcrypt**, **md5**, and **wordpress** are supported.

    <Aside title="bcrypt $2b variant support">

  If you are importing bcrypt hashes with the $2b variant, Kinde will substitute this for the $2a variant. These are interchangeable as long as you were not running OpenBSD at the time the hashes were generated.

    </Aside>

- `salt` - extra characters added to passwords to make them stronger
- `salt_position` - position of salt in password string. Prefix (before) or suffix (after).

  | Hashing method | Salt     | Salt position             |
  | -------------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
  | md5            | Optional | required if salt included |
  | bcrypt         |          |                           |
  | crypt          | Optional |                           |
  | wordpress      | Optional |                           |

- `is_temporary_password` - indicates a single use password, the user will be prompted to set a new password after the first time they use it.
