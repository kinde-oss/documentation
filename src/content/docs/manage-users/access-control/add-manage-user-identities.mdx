You can add and manage a user’s identity in Kinde. This includes their Kinde profile, contact, and sign in identity information. [Learn more about identities in Kinde](/authenticate/about-auth/identity-and-verification/).

This topic explains how to add identities manually in Kinde - you might do it this way as a one-off task. You can also add identities via the Kinde Management API. You might do it this way for bulk processes.

## Add an identity

1. In Kinde, go to **Users**.
2. Search or browse for the user you want to update. 
3. In the **Profile** page for the user, in the **Identities** section, select **Add identity**.
4. In the dialog, choose the identity type and enter the details.
5. Select **Save**.

Create a username, email or phone identity via API: `POST /users/{user_id}/identities`

## Delete an identity

You can’t edit an identity record as it can break authentication for a user. Instead, add a new identity before you delete the old one.

1. In Kinde, go to **Users**.
2. Search or browse for the user you want to update. 
3. In the **Profile** page for the user, in the **Identities** section, locate the identity you want to delete.
4. Select the three dots menu and select **Delete identity**.

Delete a username, email or phone identity via API: `DELETE /identities/{identity_id}`

## Make a contact identity primary

Primary contact information gets passed in the ID token for the user. You can change the primary identity.

1. In Kinde, go to **Users**.
2. Search or browse for the user you want to update. 
3. In the **Profile** page for the user, in the **Identities** section, locate the identity you want to make primary.
4. Select the three dots menu and select **Make primary**.

Make an identity the primary one (`is_primary`) via API: `PATCH /identities/{identity_id}`

## Update a user identity

You can’t directly edit identities in Kinde. You need to add a new identity and delete the old one to update identity records.
